<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long journey for me and my company. We&rsquo;ve achieved much. And yes, we&rsquo;ve made mistakes. But we&rsquo;ve learned and grown along the way. Today, I run one of the most successful WordPress Theme building companies in the world. And it wasn&rsquo;t easy to reach the top.</p>
<p>But why should you struggle?</p>
<p>Now that I am a success and reaping the rewards, I believe firmly that I should help those in my industry. Whether you&rsquo;re just starting out or having trouble getting your web development business to the next level - I want to help.</p>
<p>The best way I can do that is to pass on what I&rsquo;ve learned. To highlight the challenges you will face and how best to overcome them. To show you how to prepare for difficult circumstances and how to turn a new or failing business into a profitable, life-changing endeavour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the purpose of this book.</p>
<p>You hold in your hands a blueprint. A plan to take you from the anonymous sea of countless WordPress developers to one who is sought after by clients. This book will help you become a success and chart the way ahead, cutting through all of the trials and tribulations to provide a no-nonsense approach to building your reputation as a theme builder.</p>
<p>My approach to writing this book has been to provide as much value to the reader as possible.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this guide to earning $1million selling WordPress themes, each chapter has been laid out in similar fashion. This formatting is designed to shorten the learning process. I want you to pick up and internalize the techniques I&rsquo;ve used to be a success as quickly as possible. Study is <i>very</i> important to keep one step ahead of your competition, but only through action can you achieve your goals. Stating my winning formula, and the winning formula of my company, Stylemix, in as clear and concise a way as possible means you spend less time reading and more time on making your WordPress theme business the best it can be.</p>
<p>Each chapter will begin with a brief introductory paragraph about the topics contained in that chapter. It will state what the <i>learning outcomes</i> are. In other words - what you should know by the end of the chapter. At the conclusion of each chapter I&rsquo;ll then restate what you have learned to reinforce this.</p>
<p>This formatting allows you to:</p>
<p>1. Find the information you need quickly.</p>
<p>2. Treat this guide as a reference book, returning to the chapters you most need to brush up on.</p>
<p>3. Ensure that by the end of a chapter, you really have learned what you&rsquo;re supposed to have. If not, you can go back over the sections of each chapter you feel you need to return to.</p>
<p>With the formalities over. Let&rsquo;s get to building your $1million dollar WordPress theme business!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in messing around, and neither should you. When you bought this book, your first question was probably &ldquo;how did Igor make a million dollars selling WordPress Themes?&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s the crux of the book. There are so many web development and business books out there which may have some good things to say, but the reader is left asking: But did these techniques really work for the writer? Or is he/she just regurgitating other personal development books to make a quick buck?</p>
<p>Let me make this clear. I founded and run a successful theme building business for well over a decade. That business has made me a millionaire. I want you to have that success as well. And you can! I don&rsquo;t just talk the talk, I&rsquo;ve lived and breathed these techniques. They&rsquo;ve changed my life for the better, and now I want to give something back to you and others like you who just need the right tools to become a success.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I&rsquo;m going to show you how I did it. This is my story, the trials and tribulations. If you want to skip to subsequent chapters and read my technical advice going in depth on each technique I used, please do. However, this chapter contains a story which, when things seem difficult for you, I want you to remember. I want you to remember how I made all this happen for myself. And knowing how I did it, will empower you to make those same strides in your life and in your business.</p>
<p>In chapter two we will discuss some of the strategies I used to save my business when in difficulty. After this, we&rsquo;ll go into much more detail about the techniques you need to employ. But for now, sit back. Let me tell you a story about how all this came to pass, and how you can make that change for yourself, too.</p>
<h2>My First Experience in Business </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole</i> <i>goes</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Morpheus, &ldquo;The Matrix&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From an early age, I developed two character traits which have been the foundation to everything I have achieved:</p>
<p>● Creativity</p>
<p>● Passion for experimentation.</p>
<p>I know that you have these two qualities within you as well. You might not have consciously thought about them before, but if you didn&rsquo;t have a desire to create, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to build a</p>
<p>business. If you didn&rsquo;t have a passion for experimentation, then you wouldn&rsquo;t have bought this book. Taking the chance to learn something <i>is </i> an experiment. We never quite know how it&rsquo;ll work out, but we&rsquo;re willing to take that chance. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re taking that journey with me.</p>
<p>Because of these two traits, I feel my life naturally pointed towards becoming a businessperson at a young age. But whatever age you are, whenever you made that realisation. You&rsquo;re here now, and that&rsquo;s all that matters.</p>
<p>Despite having both creativity and a passion for experimentation, I was like a lot of kids and teenagers. My parents were strict. My mom especially always said to me &ldquo;first study, then everything else&rdquo;. She knew the importance of learning and discipline. Unfortunately, I enjoyed computer games and soccer a little too much and it could be a struggle to sit down and study when I knew I wanted to kick a ball about or jump into a video game and forget my worries.</p>
<p>My parents continued to push me in one direction. They wanted me to become a doctor, but medicine did not interest me at all. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I wanted to help people - one of the reasons for writing this book - but I knew my talents were not best suited to becoming a medical doctor. I also found hospitals to be frightening places from a young age, especially when considering that some people die there. I don&rsquo;t say this to demean the medical profession, I believe those drawn to it are amazing people, but I wanted to focus on where life was strong.</p>
<p>Where it thrived.</p>
<p>From an early age then, I learned a valuable lesson:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be true to yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what others want for you, but what you want for yourself. Therein lies discipline and hard work. But most of all a passion for something you care about. That&rsquo;s what web development has been for me. You see, like Morpheus in The Matrix, I was offered a choice by life. The red or the blue pill:</p>
<p><b>The Blue Pill</b>: The story ends there. I would have become a doctor or other medical professional. I&rsquo;d have been wealthy. I&rsquo;d have had job security. But I&rsquo;d have been unhappy.</p>
<p><b>The Red Pill</b>: This is the choice I made. To take a leap into the dark. I wanted to build something for myself from scratch. I wanted to be my own boss. There was no job security there. I had to do it all for myself. It was dangerous. The outcome was not clear. And that was just fine with me. So, I took the Red Pill, metaphorically speaking.</p>
<p>As soon as I made the decision to follow my dreams, the world made sense. I was enthused. I was excited. I knew I wanted to be a businessman. An entrepreneur who doesn&rsquo;t need to answer to anyone else. A person who makes things. A person who offers something new to the world.</p>
<p>From there, I prioritized German as a second language and mathematics. My dream was to study economics and one day graduate with a degree in Business Administration. In wasn&rsquo;t all dry studying though. After picking up first in the Republic&rsquo;s Language Academic Competition and receiving a grant to attend a top-tier university, I started to look around me.</p>
<h2>Cultivating Positivity and Leadership </h2>
<p>Now, this is important.</p>
<p>You can learn a lot from people. Whether they are knowingly teaching you or not. You can learn both what to do and what not to do. But what I loved the most was being around people who inspired me. My friends at university did that. I learned that they too had ambitions. I surrounded myself with like-minded people and all through those crazy University days when I cut loose more than once, I soaked up one word: <i>Possibility</i>. I used my experiences from University where I studied business. There, I learned much by immersing myself in the field of International Relations and Politics for 5 years. This has greatly informed my understanding of people and how to influence them positively. It&rsquo;s also helped me know when to act, when to push forward, and when to leverage my strengths to achieve a goal.</p>
<p>Life is full of possibilities. It&rsquo;s out there to be had, to be sculpted into whatever you want it to be.</p>
<p>I need you to know that. I need you to feel that in your very core. You have to believe.</p>
<p>Surrounding yourself with other hard workers and dreamers is the best way to reinforce that belief. Go out, find like-minded people. You&rsquo;ll soak up the inspiration and it will put fire into your belly. You&rsquo;ll want to go out and make your WordPress theme business the best one available.</p>
<p>Psych yourself up for the challenge by knowing that, if possible, surrounding yourself with people who want to make successful businesses is the best way to cultivate that feeling in yourself.</p>
<p>Then pass on that good feeling. Hold your head up and show that you believe in yourself.</p>
<p>Someone else will be watching. A friend, a colleague, a passerby, and they&rsquo;ll be inspired by you.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean blind faith or believing in the impossible, but it does mean <i>knowing</i> that you can achieve something and exuding the confidence that you can do it. This will make potential business clients, investors, and staff want to support and follow you.</p>
<p>I learned much about this even from a young age when I was interested in video games (I still am!). I played many games on PC and PlayStation including Counter Strike, FIFA, and even Need for Speed. I actually became one of the best players in my home city. This was an excellent glimpse into the world of applying yourself to reach a goal. So, if someone ever tells you that video games are bad for you, just remember that when used in moderation, they are an excellent way to test yourself, work as part of a team, and build character! I always wanted to be the best I can be, and this sense of accomplishment drove me on to create businesses with that same ambition.</p>
<h2>Accepting Help &amp; Developing Gratitude </h2>
<p>No one is a self-made businessperson. They may have done 90% of it, but there&rsquo;s always that 10% where someone helped you achieve your goals. Whether it&rsquo;s a friend who works on a logo for you for free or a fellow freelancer who refers you to a client as a web developer.</p>
<p>Be willing to accept help when you need it. Don&rsquo;t let pride stop you from maximising everything in your life to make your business happen. I don&rsquo;t mean just taking from those around you, but I do mean accepting assistance from others humbly, knowing that this will help you get your business to where you want it to be.</p>
<p>In my case, I accepted help from my Uncle. I had this burning desire to want to be a millionaire before I was 30. I wanted it so much I could taste it. When I graduated from university, I knew immediately that I needed to set up my own business; to maximise what I had learned from all those years of study. I wanted it so badly, I was able to put my pride aside and use any advantage in my life I could find.</p>
<p>My uncle had a small sewing shop, so the idea came to me to sell T-shirts. Was it a million dollar idea? Probably not. But it was a way to finally make something happen for myself. Using my uncle&rsquo;s workshop to design and make T-shirts. I made strides and sold them on campus, but as my sales grew and grew. Something was missing. I needed something more than just raking in sales. I needed purpose.</p>
<p>And you will too.</p>
<h2>Finding Purpose </h2>
<p>In 2006, while I was still studying, my cousin Victor offered me an opportunity. He told us we could make money by making websites and content management. I knew next to nothing about IT or working with websites at the time. But as I said before <i>soak up everything around you</i>.</p>
<p>Listen and prepare to learn.</p>
<p>And so, I gave it a shot. That shot changed my life and opened my eyes.</p>
<p>You see, my T-shirt selling business had showed me I could be successful on a small scale. I could make enough to get by. Over time, I could make a lot of money if I stuck to that business model and kept expanding. But something was missing. I felt empty from the endeavour.</p>
<p>Working online changed that. It made me realise that what I needed to be fulfilled in business was to:</p>
<p>1. Be productive and keep learning.</p>
<p>2. Stay relevant by learning about cutting-edge technologies (last time I checked no one has cancelled progress).</p>
<p>3. Be able to grow a dynamic business on a worldwide stage.</p>
<p>4. Help people build their dreams.</p>
<p>5. Interact with customers and help resolve any issues they might have.</p>
<p>These five points gave me purpose. They fired me up like I&rsquo;d never been fired up before. I loved feeling that way, and that just spurred me on to bigger and better things.</p>
<p>The take away from this is that you should try to find purpose and passion in your theme business. Don&rsquo;t just treat it like a disposable means to an end. T-shirts were that for me. But in the highly competitive world of web development, you need to be passionate. Not just for yourself and your team, but also for your customers. Each website you help create can be a portal for them to bigger things. A business they need to sell products, a blog to express themselves, or a site exploring <i>their</i> passion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important. You&rsquo;re facilitating other people&rsquo;s lives. That&rsquo;s a wonderful thing. Get fired up about that. Make that your purpose, and your business will fly. Your customers will know you care, and you&rsquo;ll put the time and hard work into becoming the best developer you can be.</p>
<p>With that sort of purpose, you&rsquo;ll be unstoppable! I am, and you can be, too.</p>
<h2>Small Steps Lead to a Great Journey </h2>
<p>By the time Victor and I came to grips with just what creating online services and content meant, we realised we were at the beginning of a new revolution. But we didn&rsquo;t become a success overnight. We didn&rsquo;t even start with WordPress! We started building websites designed to generate traffic on Google. Then, using Google Adsense, those websites would slowly generate advertising revenue. We didn&rsquo;t just make the sites, we filled them with content.</p>
<p>Remember, again, <i>soak up what&rsquo;s around you</i>.</p>
<p>I knew many students, and so we asked them to fill the websites with articles. The sites were designed to get a good ranking on search engines and to be attractive to visitors interested in whatever niche topic the website was about.</p>
<p>Word of mouth was our main source of new clients. But remember what I said - with passion and purpose, the end product is positive. The offers began flying in. Clients wanted their own websites built from scratch.</p>
<p>This was all achieved with small steps. Just putting one foot in front of the other. By the time I looked back, I realised we had come a long distance. But the business was saturated. I couldn&rsquo;t keep up with orders and my web design experience at that point was limited. I realised there was only one thing to do:</p>
<p>Scale up!</p>
<h2>Bigger Means Better </h2>
<p>I got in touch with some other web developers and together we created a team of creative, productive people. Soon, we could handle more orders. It was the same business, only on a larger scale. It was that simple to increase our profit margin. Plus, with several talented people alongside me, I was able to be humble and learn more. To soak it all up and become a better person, a better businessman, and a better developer.</p>
<p>Soon, we opened up our own office. With developers assisting me, I was free to spend more time on marketing. So, I studied. I learned. I looked at how other people were leveraging their talents online. It became simple. I looked to marketplaces like Elance (now Upwork). Upwork is a digital job marketplace for freelancers. You set up a profile and bid for jobs based on your experience and work rate. The more you work, the more you receive good reviews, and the more clients you attract. It snowballed from there.</p>
<p>You might think it sounds like we were rolling in cash at this point. Nope. We weren&rsquo;t. We were making enough to keep the lights on, but that was about it. However, I believed. I had passion. I had a purpose. I knew that with this steady foundation in place, we could as a team move forward and achieve something truly worthwhile.</p>
<p>We just needed to keep moving forward and scaling up.</p>
<h2>Embrace the Learning Curve </h2>
<p>While working with Upwork, I continued to learn. I was surprised by the sheer number of people from all walks of life that I had to interact with. That was a great lesson for me. Working with so many clients, I began to understand their psychology. I figured out how to meet their needs and almost always guarantee a 5 star rating. I also learned how to identify problematic clients and how to deal with them. These lessons I have kept with me to this day. And we&rsquo;ll be discussing them in greater detail in a later chapter.</p>
<p>One of the most positive interactions I had was with a long term client. He was just starting out as an entrepreneur and we got on famously. In our conversations, I learned a lot from him, and I like to think that my work and my team&rsquo;s work helped him build up and move forward. His name was Dan Norris, and today he is an extremely successful businessman, coach and author of the bestseller The 7 Day Startup. Among others.</p>
<p>Again, this comes back to soaking up what&rsquo;s happening around you. Learning. Adapting. And being a good person. Positive. Acting with passion and purpose. You&rsquo;ll make long term connections that way, I promise. Connections which will enrich your professional and sometimes even personal life.</p>
<p>I continued to better myself each and every day. Sure, it was tiring at times, and we all have bad days, but the trend was moving upwards. I kept the momentum, and I never took my foot off the gas. You shouldn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<h2>The WordPress Revolution </h2>
<p>Around this time I started to notice that more and more clients were requesting that we design themes for WordPress. Noticing this trend, I knew that we would have to maximize it to increase our revenue. So, I did the groundwork. Research. Research. Research. I discovered that with Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress, savvy developers were able to create themes which could be sold on mass to millions of people. Just think about that - one theme which can be customised and used for many purposes. Before this, people had to design each website one site at a time.</p>
<p>We could create themes which were ready made and easily installed by those with just a little WordPress knowledge. That opened up possibilities for users, and it opened up a worldwide marketplace for us.</p>
<p>But how best to reach that market?</p>
<p>My research led me to websites which were selling those themes. Places which operated much like Upwork - a marketplace for freelancers. But, these sites focussed purely on web development. It all made sense. Where would a businessperson go to find the best websites?</p>
<p>To a site that specializes in exactly that, of course.</p>
<p>Theme markets had appeared, and I stared at Themeforest knowing it was the future for my business. WordPress had changed everything, and Themeforest was a ready made platform that I could profit from. I was soaking it all up again. Still ready to learn.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t all roses.</p>
<h2>Instability and Uncertainty </h2>
<p>I had continual challenges I had to meet. The workload wasn&rsquo;t consistent. Some weeks we&rsquo;d have too much work to do pulling all nighters to meet our deadlines. Other weeks, we&rsquo;d have nothing happening. That put a tremendous amount of stress on my team. It&rsquo;s natural to worry about where your next paycheck is going to come from, and how much it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the life of a developer is never easy or simple.</p>
<p>But I faced it all with zeal. I knew I couldn&rsquo;t let down my team. They had to be paid. I had to find the work, so I spent a lot of time sourcing new clients and marketing the business.</p>
<p>The competition from other job markets was fierce, and you&rsquo;ll face this yourself. People living in poorer countries were able and willing to charge pennies for large projects. I can&rsquo;t blame them for that, but the disparity in standards of living across different countries means someone working in the US, for example, is going to have to compete somehow with someone in India who can charge a tenth of the price.</p>
<p>That meant focussing on higher paying clients. I had to find clients who really cared about their businesses, and so were willing to pay a decent rate for having a first class website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is when I hit my biggest hurdle. And it was completely out of my hands.</p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2010, the world economy tanked. Clients cut their cloth accordingly. That meant having much reduced budgets for everything, including web design. A massive 80% of our clients could not or would not pay the older fees. So, we had to renegotiate, and that meant each order was going out for far less.</p>
<p>I knew I could not go on like that, and neither could the business. Something had to change. I had to adapt. I had to learn. I had to save the business.</p>
<p>And that was when I decided to rethink my business strategy. A priceless lesson we&rsquo;ll explore in the next chapter.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re nearly finished with the history of my company. By the end of this chapter, you&rsquo;ll have a broad understanding of how I moved from budding entrepreneur to reaching the top of my field.</p>
<p>That should give you an idea of why ThemeForest is a great opportunity for you, as well as avoiding some stumbling blocks along the way. After this, we&rsquo;ll get into the nitty gritty and address each stage of building your successful theme selling business.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn:</p>
<p>1. How I changed strategy transformed my business</p>
<p>2. The basic ThemeForest submission process.</p>
<p>Remember, only through understanding can you truly know what you&rsquo;re doing. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re just throwing strategies against the wall to see what sticks. I&rsquo;ve already done that for you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to blindly see what works. Just follow my plan, and you <i>will</i> be a success!</p>
<h2>Changing Strategy </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The truest wisdom is a resolute determination</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Napoleon Bonaparte</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After three years of slogging it out, grinding away to find clients who would pay enough for me to keep my team afloat, I knew I had to find a longer term solution. Chasing your tail constantly <i>is</i> <i>not</i> a good way to run a business. You need to be relaxed, focussed, and determined. Not desperate and over eager. That leads to burnout and mistakes.</p>
<p>My time was increasingly spent on:</p>
<p>● <b>Chasing Money</b>: Any freelancer or small business knows about the dangers of the invoicing period. You&rsquo;ve done the work, now you just need to get paid, right? It&rsquo;s rarely that simple, especially when dealing with other small businesses who have intermittent cash flow. I spent an inordinate amount of time sending invoices, chasing up payment via email, even on the phone to clients trying to get the money we were owed promptly, without burning bridges for future work. </p>
<p>● <b>Chasing Marketing Strategies</b>: I was constantly concerned with increasing the scope of my business. Spending more and more time on getting the word out there and less on actually building websites which in of themselves are the best piece of marketing a developer can have. </p>
<p>● <b>Chasing Clients</b>: A constant search for new clients, in tandem with marketing strategies, was a <i>huge</i> time sink, but one which was essential. However, business to business emails and other cold calling strategies could only go so far. </p>
<p>The bottom line is, I had very little time left over to really expand the business in a measured and strategically well-thought-out way. Each week was a mad dash to find clients and invoice them, that sometimes it felt as if we were in a Catch 22 situation: If we took some time to think about how to grow the business, we&rsquo;d lose out on clients. But, if we focussed purely on client business, there would be no time to grow the business strategically, which would then lead to us losing out on even more potential business in the future.</p>
<p>It was a difficult place to be, but not unfamiliar for entrepreneurs. Often, the first few years of any business are about keeping your head above water and making sure there&rsquo;s money to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>What I needed to find was a way to be economical with my time. To find a way to make the business self-sustaining. In other words, I had to focus on automating the process.</p>
<p>Just that revelation itself, changed everything.</p>
<h2>Enter ThemeForest </h2>
<p>As we continued to work with existing clients, we found as a team that there was a new trend.</p>
<p>One which I knew we could take advantage of - clients were increasingly asking us to modify existing themes rather than creating WordPress themes from scratch for them.</p>
<p>And where did those themes come from? Yup, ThemeForest!</p>
<h2>Exploring the Forest </h2>
<p>Remember what I said in the previous chapter about soaking up your environment? Learn from it and then adapt. With our clientbase asking us to modify ThemeForest themes, I had to learn as much about this new marketplace as possible, to see if there was anything from it we could use.</p>
<p>I visited ThemeForest.net and was blown away by their marketplace. There was I in desperate need of automating some of our sales process, and a marketplace already existed which could make that possible! It was synergy.</p>
<p>What really surprised me, however, was the number of low quality themes on ThemeForest at that time. Some of them looked like they were straight out of the 90s! And yet, they were selling by the bucket load! I couldn&rsquo;t believe how much people were willing to pay for really basic WordPress themes.</p>
<p>There was an opportunity then to stand out from the pack. All we had to do as a team was upload a ThemeForest theme which was of a much higher quality than most of the others available there.</p>
<p>The problem was time.</p>
<h2>Finding Time to Plant in the Forest </h2>
<p>I knew that we had the talent to make a theme which would blow users away. But, as I mentioned above, I had very little time. Most of my time was taken up with just keeping the business afloat with new and existing clients. With so little time, many business owners put off working on a new part of the business which will pay dividends in the future. I could no longer wait. The last three years had taught me that I had to make the leap and get a ThemeForest theme made and uploaded. But how?</p>
<p>Remember: <b>There is always a solution! </b></p>
<p>I was able to cut some business costs and put some money aside so that my team could work overtime. They were happy for the work, but had I not been able to do this, I would have found a qualified collaborator on Upwork.</p>
<p>This was a tense time. We worked ridiculous hours, but it was the only way for a short time. We put in extra hours at the end of each day working on our new ThemeForest theme. This involved three aspects:</p>
<p>● <b>Study</b>: We had to learn everything we could about how ThemeForest worked, not to mention studying the competition to see what worked and what didn&rsquo;t for customers. We had to peruse ThemeForest blogs, developer guides, forum posts, and any other piece of information we could get our hands on to improve our chances for success. Always learn! </p>
<p>● <b>Discussed</b>: While you have to be able to delegate as a business leader, you also have to listen. I had a great team working with me, and so it was important to listen to their input. What were their thoughts? How could we make a better theme than the competition? How could we speed up the process? Sometimes there were arguments.</p>
<p>But I managed to keep us together and made the design choices when they had to be finalised. </p>
<p>● <b>Planned</b>: Once design decisions were made, we drew up plans for the theme. You don&rsquo;t have to be the best at mocking up graphics, but having a clear blueprint for how your theme will display, keeps everyone moving in the same direction. Later, you can always alter things if something isn&rsquo;t working. </p>
<p>This process consumed my life for two months. I plunged into studying this niche, learning as much as I could, working with my team fueled on caffeine and passion. We were ready to make our first theme.</p>
<h2>Our First ThemeForest Upload </h2>
<p>Doubt is an important part of the learning process. It&rsquo;s important to know when to be humble and when to be confident. But you should never let the doubt cripple you, or allow overconfidence to blind your judgement.</p>
<p>Keep a good amount of <i>healthy doubt</i>.</p>
<p>This type of doubt is about learning and moving forward. It&rsquo;s about never believing that you or your business is the finished article, but that you have the confidence to learn any new skill.</p>
<p>I had my doubts about whether we&rsquo;d all succeed, but I knew that if we kept at the plan, we&rsquo;d have something we could be proud of in the end. What increased that doubt, however, was a feeling that it was all too easy. We<a href="https://themeforest.net/legal/author?_ga=2.14067127.1640929756.1519281566-817032453.1519281566"> created an author&rsquo;s account </a>following ThemeForest&rsquo;s guidelines. We then uploaded our finished theme. It was a portfolio theme designed for creatives and so we submitted it under ThemeForest&rsquo;s Creative category.</p>
<p>Then we had to wait for approval. That&rsquo;s right, you can&rsquo;t simply upload a theme and start selling it to the masses. ThemeForest have to keep the quality of the themes they sell to a decent standard, so someone had to look at our portfolio to give it the go ahead. </p>
<h2>Disappointment </h2>
<p>We were in for a rude awakening. The approval process took a week, and it was an agonizing wait! Finally, we heard back, and the feedback was not great. Basically, &ldquo;better luck next time, guys!&rdquo; We were told that our theme did not have a &ldquo;competent visual hierarchy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I was at a loss. I had no idea what that meant!</p>
<p>At this point, we could have thrown in the towel and focussed purely on our existing clients. But no, we wanted more, <i>I</i> wanted more. Firmly believing that there is <i>always a solution</i> I set myself the task of finding the issue, fixing it, and then resubmitting.</p>
<h2>Back on the Horse </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Get back on the horse that threw you</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Ancient Proverb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone was pretty despondent by this point. And you can imagine why, two months of overtime down the drain! Yes, everyone was paid for their time, but we all took pride in our work. To see a project which we had put so much into not come to fruition was heartbreaking.</p>
<p>There was nothing else for it but to get back to it and redouble our efforts!</p>
<p>After two days of further study, I finally found the answer to our problem. The solution was on the Envato forum. It appeared that our theme was overloaded, and the information presented to users of the theme was out of order. You see, the &ldquo;hierarchy&rdquo; of a theme describes how information is displayed to the user. A &ldquo;good&rdquo; theme has a hierarchy which shows the most important information first in a concise way, and then either through browsing other pages or scrolling down the homepage, then provides more in-depth information.</p>
<p>The way we had designed our theme meant that our sections and text formatting were in the wrong order to be useful to anyone using the theme. If a photographer, for example, wanted to use our portfolio to showcase their work, it wouldn&rsquo;t have exhibited their work in a pleasing or organised way. At least, the most important photographs and text blocks would not have appeared at the top of the page (don&rsquo;t worry if this seems unclear, we&rsquo;ll go into design choices in greater depth in later chapters).</p>
<h2>Fixing Our Theme </h2>
<p>A good theme designer is always able to accept criticism and redesign their themes. For our first ThemeForest theme, we had to do just that. Now knowing what the issue was, we went through the entire theme from top to bottom. First, we chose to fix up the HTML template because it was easier to alter the theme quickly, rather than in the WordPress theme. After that, we submitted for the second time, and&hellip;</p>
<p>We got refused again!</p>
<p><i>But</i>, the difference here was that it was a soft refusal. We just had a few bugs to work through, our design choices were on point!</p>
<p>After another pass, we went through our scripts and corrected the bugs. That led to our third submission and&hellip; Success! We were accepted. The theme was called FlexFolio. It was light and stylish, and could be customised in a number of ways. Was it our best ThemeForest theme? No! We knew we had to work hard to keep improving, but the main point was that it was more than useful for users.</p>
<h2>Onwards and Upwards </h2>
<p>Using ThemeForest allowed us to automate our marketing to a great degree. Like eBay, Upwork, and other listing sites, ThemeForest gave us instant access to a huge number of potential clients. That meant I no longer had to spend my time constantly chasing down new leads! Of course, I still chased some work outside of ThemeForest, but being able to list our themes allowed me to take more time to improve other aspects of the business and most importantly improve our skills as a team. In the first few weeks we made 30 sales, and that put us high up on ThemeForest&rsquo;s listings. We were on our way!</p>
<p>Now that you know my history and have learned from it, let&rsquo;s leverage these lessons and make your future a success as a theme designer! In the next chapter, we&rsquo;re going to outline how to build a theme from scratch. After that, each chapter will take an in depth look at techniques and strategies to make your ThemeForest business a success.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>

<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>


<p>I&rsquo;ve watched many developers fail and succeed. Paying attention to the theme developers around me has helped me understand where that thin line is between failure and success. Have you ever wondered why some people pour their heart and soul into ThemeForest and fail, while others reach their goals?</p>
<p>Through my own experiences I have come to realise that while desire, dedication, and skill are incredibly important, they are not enough on their own. There&rsquo;s another part of building themes which separates the successes from the failures - I call it <i>Company Culture</i>. If you want to significantly increase your chances for success, I recommend to developers of all skill levels, that they should learn about company culture and develop their own version of this over time.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn:</p>
<p>1. What company culture contributes to a theme developer.</p>
<p>2. How to generate your own company culture.</p>
<p>3. How company culture shaped the beginnings of my company, StylemixThemes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk briefly about what this aspect of building themes is, why it&rsquo;s important, and how you can use this understanding to make a million dollars on ThemeForest.</p>
<h2>What is Company Culture? </h2>
<p>Company Culture is the very soul of your developer business. It&rsquo;s the fundamental way you and your team interact with each other and the values you create while getting the work done. Over time, you build a &ldquo;culture&rdquo; of doing things. This is created by everyone involved over time as you&rsquo;re all working on designing and selling themes together, but as a team leader or even being a developer on your own, it&rsquo;s down to you to chart the course ahead.</p>
<p>What sort of company culture do you want to have and develop? The atmosphere you create within your team has a huge part to play in all of this. You lead by example, and that in turn creates the atmosphere and values of your company. I&rsquo;ve noticed through my experiences of running StylemixThemes that as human beings we all have the herd instinct - we all want to follow the group. The way we behave towards each other and the way we carry out our work is quickly picked up and copied by those around us. So, you need to create a good example and establish the cultural values of your company in a productive way, because those around you will adopt those same values.</p>
<p>It takes a little patience. Whether you&rsquo;re on your own as a developer and trying to cultivate positive habits for yourself or if you have a large team who you want to take on your set of values, it&rsquo;s an ongoing process.</p>
<h2>Why is Company Culture Important? </h2>
<p>Everything stems from your company culture, and it&rsquo;s highly contagious! For example, if you hire a new member to your team and they see people coming into your office late all of the time, they will then think that is acceptable. Before you know it, your new team member - who should be trying to impress you in the early phases - is strolling in late each day and you&rsquo;re missing out on valuable time. But, if your team is on time consistently, your new team member will implicitly follow the group rule that they shouldn&rsquo;t be tardy either.</p>
<p>This is the power of company culture and why it&rsquo;s so important. Good behaviours and attitudes bring about more positive attitudes. With a positive culture in place, you and your team members will be producing high quality themes at a much more productive rate, and selling them.</p>
<h2>My Experience of Creating the Best Values </h2>
<p>Whenever I advise new or struggling developers to look at their company culture to overcome their issues, I&rsquo;m quickly asked for pointers about the exact type of company culture you should have. This is going to vary from developer to developer. What you think of as acceptable might be different from what I think is acceptable. However, I can pass on StylemixThemes&rsquo; company culture, and our history of how we developed it, to you so that you can apply and adapt them to your needs.</p>
<p>My experience with company culture began early. Even before I started selling WordPress themes in ThemeForest. If you remember, in the previous chapters when I told you my story of becoming a developer, I had started selling websites to a high number of low paying customers in the beginning. We had somewhere in the region of 40 - 50 customers per month. As is sometimes the case, the lower paying customers expected me and my team to work wonders for very little financial return. In fact, some of them were so demanding of us that I would describe them affectionately as a &ldquo;pain in the ass&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I realised very quickly that I could do one of two things:</p>
<p>1. I could get frustrated and tell those customers their demands were unreasonable. Or</p> 
<p>2. I could get on with things and do my best regardless.</p>
<p>I am so glad I chose the second option. You see, when I took the decision to keep those low paying, demanding customers happy with our service, this had a huge knock on effect with the StylemixThemes team. I instructed the managers and other team members to always focus on having positive conversations with those customers. Even behind closed doors, I encouraged</p>
<p>my team to be forward thinking and try to always speak positively about the projects we were working on.</p>
<p>This positive approach was infectious, and it increased the number of projects we could work on because as a team we were all moving in the right direction. We helped each other build a positive company culture which was focussed on getting things right for the customer. That led to great reviews and bolstered our reputation. It also brought in more work from repeat customers!</p>
<h2>Incentivising You and Your Team </h2>
<p>Another great way I found to create positive values was to incentivise good outcomes. Let&rsquo;s face it, not everyone is going to be as motivated to continually move your themes forward and create a successful business. Sometimes team members will become unproductive or cultivate a negative outlook when it comes to the work. By incentivising or rewarding good outcomes, I gave them something to shoot for when contributing - something more than simply being proud of the work. I hit gold with this approach, and you can, too.</p>
<p>You know early on in my career as a developer, it took me a few years to truly appreciate company culture and creating these rewards. But once I did, the results were huge. When I was working with my support managers, I rewarded positive outcomes. My system looked like this:</p>
<p>● If the items were given a 5 star review, then I would pay them an extra $5</p>
<p>● If they were given a 4 star review, then that meant we had failed the customer in some way. The support staff were then penalised $5 for that.</p>
<p>● For a 3 star review, they were penalised $15.</p>
<p>● A 2 star review resulted in a $25 penalty.</p>
<p>● And a 1 star review resulted in a $50 penalty.</p>
<p>So what was the outcome of this? The support staff felt motivated to get those 5 star reviews whenever they could. If they did well, they knew they&rsquo;d make money, and if they didn&rsquo;t perform or dropped the ball, then they&rsquo;d make less money. This created a value for 5 star reviews which has since become ingrained in StylemixThemes&rsquo; culture. It&rsquo;s one of the main reasons we get such great support feedback from customers.</p>
<p>Now we have four support staff. On average, they make an extra $250-$300 between them for their efforts each month. That&rsquo;s a great incentive.</p>
<p>And what if you&rsquo;re currently working alone? It&rsquo;s simple, reward yourself for hard work and penalise yourself when you don&rsquo;t give 100% effort. Be an example to yourself. This can be as simple as not allowing yourself to watch your favourite TV show that night or refusing yourself a treat like a coffee or night out. There are countless ways to incentivise you and your team to create a positive company culture. It&rsquo;s been a winning approach for me. </p>
<h2>When I Gave More than Just Money </h2>
<p>I was so happy when I saw this approach for creating values work. But I knew that I still had more to do to get my team to where it needed to be. At first I thought I just had to focus on staff salaries, and as they increased, so too would the quality of our themes and our output. The funny thing is, money is only half the battle. Those incentives only got me so far, and so it became clear that I had to go beyond simple finances for my staff.</p>
<p>As I pushed for higher salaries, I wasn&rsquo;t getting better performance after a point. As a company, we then later finally understood that for many money is not the best motivator in the workplace.</p>
<p>So, I started to think about other ways to create a good company culture with my team members. After some thought I narrowed it down to three other things I could give my team: </p>
<ol>    
<li> Comfort</li> 
<li> Opportunities </li>
<li> A Mission Statement </li>
</ol>    

<h2>Comfort</h2>
<p>As financial incentives alone weren&rsquo;t enough to get the most out of my team, I thought about what I would like in a workplace and how that would make me perform. Immediately, the word&ldquo;comfort&rdquo; came to me. Who doesn&rsquo;t want to be comfortable? For you and me, our theme selling business is our passion, and so we might put up with a lot of discomfort to make that dream happen. But for an employee, they need a comfortable environment in which to work.</p>
<p>Making sure designers and support staff had the correct computers and other tech to make their jobs easier was a no-brainer in terms of productivity, but I wanted them to be <i>really</i> comfortable at StylemixThemes. I wanted them to say to their friends and family about how cool it was to work with us.</p>
<p>The answer? Fun!</p>
<p>I invested in a Cyber Games room complete with a PS4, an HTC VR headset, and five powerful gaming computers. At our offices, my teammates could then take some downtime when they needed it and relax in between the hard work. This significantly improved the comfort levels of my team, but more than that, it created a sense of community and belonging. As long as they did the work, my teammates could have fun, creating a company culture of camaraderie and energy.</p>
<p>Even with this in place, I thought about <i>discomfort</i>. Sometimes my teammates would face difficult events in their lives, needing someone to talk to - I gave them this, as well. At StylemixThemes, as soon as we could afford it, we put in place a staff psychologist who was there to listen to any issues. This created a company value of care and nurture for the team.</p>
<h2>Opportunities </h2>
<p>With financial incentives and comfort taken care of, I still felt I could do more to create the perfect company culture. Something which would make myself and my teammates thrive. A big part of this was realising that many other developers use a combination of a core team, and then freelancers to help out. But what I&rsquo;d seen quickly happen, was that core team members soon felt like they might be better working from home as a freelancer. I had to give them something more, so that they would feel even more valued at our company and want to stay.</p>
<p>Otherwise, our staff turnaround would have been much larger, and that meant training up all new staff over again - a significant investment of resources and time.</p>
<p>Then I realised, people need opportunities. Give them opportunities that they don&rsquo;t get elsewhere, and they will develop a value for the company and the work they produce.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I gave them a host of opportunities, including:</p>
<p>● <b>A Free Library</b>: Each employee could order any book for personal and professional development.</p>
<p>● <b>Buying Equipment</b>: Teammates could request new equipment if they believed it would increase productivity and make their jobs easier.</p>
<p>● <b>Training</b>: Employees could enroll in any educational course or seminar for professional and personal growth.</p>
<p>● <b>Adjustments</b>: Team members could make suggestions about company policies and request further opportunities.</p>
<p>● <b>Legal Services</b>: I gave all of my staff the opportunity to consult personally with a full-time lawyer if they had legal issues.</p>
<p>● <b>Advance Payment</b>: Staff could get up to 50% advance payment if they needed it.</p>
<p>● <b>Interest Free-Loan</b>: Each employee could apply to borrow money from the company within good reason.</p>
<p>● <b>Kaizen Philosophy</b>: Teammates could offer suggestions for automating any business processes. I rewarded any successful suggestions with a bonus. </p>
<p>● <b>Investment</b>: We tried and continue to stay as open as possible to new ideas. That&rsquo;s why we are open to employees who have a sound business plan who need financing. </p>
<h2>A Mission Statement </h2>
<p>Through much trial and error, I soon came to the realisation that as well as providing financial incentives, comfort, and opportunities to my team members, that it was necessary for everyone to <i>know</i> the company values we were trying to instill. I also knew that this had to be a concise, powerful list that could always act as a guide to those who were unsure.</p>
<p>And so, I produced 7 key values for my team, and myself, to fall back on at all times:</p> 
<p><b>1. Respect the Customer</b>: Try to make each customer happy no matter what. </p>
<p><b>2. Team Tolerance</b>: Have respect, tolerance, and give time to those working around you. </p>
<p><b>3. Shared Commitment</b>: Work together towards one team goal. Share the load and always be committed to the end product. </p>
<p><b>4. Self-Development</b>: Always look to improve yourself and learn more. </p>
<p><b>5. Product Improvement</b>: Likewise, chase down all opportunities to make our themes the best they can be. </p>
<p><b>6. Efficiency</b>: Keep productivity in mind. Be as efficient as possible and do more with less, but never at the expense of the theme.</p> 
<p><b>7. Courage</b>: Speak up when you have ideas or are unhappy. Be progressive and positive -</p>
<p>never just blindly follow when there is an issue to be resolved. </p>
<p><b>Build Your Own Company Culture </b></p>
<p>Company culture has been so important for StylemixThemes. When I put all of the above in place, the business became more and more successful each step of the way. Teammates wanted to stay longer, work harder, and make the best WordPress themes on ThemeForest.</p>
<p>I encourage you to follow your own path, but to take all of this on board. Build <i>your</i> company culture or adapt mine to fit your needs - it&rsquo;s tried and tested. If I can sum the journey of developing a company culture up, it would be: Money is not the most valuable thing in our company, we value the relationships we have between each other, and we value our shared goals.</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">A Personal Brand and Why You Need One</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>

<p>At Stylemix, we&rsquo;ve worked hard to create a personal brand that customers can trust; but it hasn&rsquo;t been easy. It takes time to develop a personal brand which will work for you and your themes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to now take you through some of my experiences in building a personal brand and show you why you need to think about this when designing and selling your themes. A personal brand shouldn&rsquo;t be an afterthought, it should be a central part of the themes, documents, and websites you produce. I like to think of it as the other half of the puzzle in becoming a successful theme developer. If developing a company culture is about how your company runs internally, then your personal brand is about how your products, business, and even you as an individual appear on the outside to your customers.</p>
<p>In this chapter you&rsquo;ll learn:</p>
<p>1. How to create a personal brand.</p>
<p>2. How thinking about marketing increases your themes sales.</p>
<p>3. How to improve and continually cultivate your brand.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with looking at exactly what a personal brand is and how it will benefit you as a theme developer.</p>
<h2>What is a Personal Brand? </h2>
<p>In the simplest sense, a personal brand is everything about you and your business which promotes what you stand for. It&rsquo;s everything that the customer sees which connects all of your products, social media posts, and company messages together. Before the advent of the internet, a personal brand could consist of nothing more than a business card with nice typography and a memorable logo, but now it&rsquo;s so much more. It can include:</p>
<p>● The look and color scheme of your websites</p>
<p>● The images you use on your social media profiles</p>
<p>● The slogan of your business</p>
<p>● The logo and watermark on your promos</p>
<p>● And so much more&hellip;</p>
<h2>Why You Need a Personal Brand </h2>
<p>As a theme developer, you need to stand out from the crowd. There are countless developers out there using ThemeForest, and if you cannot be differentiated from them, then you&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>establish yourself as a leading seller. When I first started out, I knew about branding through my studies, but as with many things in life, you only truly learn a skill when you apply it.</p>
<p>I looked around at my competitors and tried to separate the successful brands from the unsuccessful ones. It became clear to me that the brands I quickly associated with producing high quality, reliable themes, were ones I would be much more inclined to buy from. And so, that&rsquo;s what I wanted for my company - to create a brand that ThemeForest users would trust.</p>
<p>More than that, I soon realised that with a personal brand customers recognised easily, people would look out for new theme releases from me and my team. Repeat business is important when selling themes on ThemeForest. Why have a customer buy one theme when over the years they could buy many?</p>
<p>Selling more themes off the back of your brand is about expectation. When you establish that you can build themes which work efficiently and have good design, customers will want to see what you come up with next. By having a personal brand, you can quickly remind customers about that quality. As soon as they see the branding on a new theme and realise it comes from you, they will remember their previous positive experience and give you more of a chance than a developer they have no experience of.</p>
<p>Lastly, your branding can <em>say</em> something about you and your themes. If you get the branding right, it can convey a mark of professionalism and reliability. In my experience, the developers who put little time into their brand building inadvertently <em>say</em> the wrong thing about their themes.</p>
<p>With poor branding, it appears like you don&rsquo;t care about the themes you&rsquo;re selling, and that&rsquo;s a death sentence for any developer. Who wants to buy a theme from someone who presents their business poorly? Not me, because in many cases the same lack of care is evident in the themes they are selling!</p>
<h2>How to Build Your Brand the StylemixThemes Way </h2>
<p>My experience with brand building was a difficult one, but like many parts of this book, I hope you can learn from my experiences so you can avoid the pitfalls and get straight onto the right path.</p>
<p>When I started, I committed myself to trial and error, knowing that building a brand for my themes wouldn't happen overnight. It was obvious to me that it would take time, otherwise every competing developer I encountered would have an excellent personal brand, and that was far from the truth. I tried to learn as much as I could from the developers who <em>did</em> have a good personal brand. One such developer was TheMolitor. I remembered TheMolitor&rsquo;s themes well, and it wasn&rsquo;t just because they were well designed and crisp. It was because they were branded, and branded in a way which gave a good impression of the work TheMolitor was producing.</p>
<p>It became clear to me that just by seeing TheMolitor&rsquo;s branding, I instinctively expected the work to be of a high quality. That would then encourage me to purchase one of the themes under that branding. TheMolitor had created an expectation in me, the customer, who was now more likely to buy several products for various websites. Of course, at this point I was just roleplaying as the customer - which is a great way to get into the mind of your potential audience. If I really wanted a theme for a specific website, I would have built it myself, as I&rsquo;m sure you would, too.</p>
<p>Practice makes perfect, afterall. </p>
<h2>An Initial Strategy </h2>
<p>I knew then that I had to emulate TheMolitor&rsquo;s branding success, but this took a great deal of time and effort. One mistake we made as a company was to have different brandings for our different themes. This can work if you customise your logo, for example, to fit the theme niche.</p>
<p>However, it means that you&rsquo;re taking away the impact of your overall logo and brand design, and not establishing it across all of your themes.</p>
<p>We also soon realised that we could brand not just our websites and themes, but also the individual components of our themes. For example, we could include a logo on our sliders, header builders, footer builders, mega menus, and even our page builders. Each time this would reinforce in our customers&rsquo; minds that they were using a StylemixThemes product. Research shows that a customer requires 5 - 7 exposures to a brand before it makes a notable impact, so in just one theme, we were able to connect our high quality design work with our company name and make a deep connection with our customers. The next time one of those customers saw an advertised StylemixThemes product, they were much more likely to pay attention to it. </p>
<h2>Improving Our Brand </h2>
<p>If you stand still in the ThemeForest world, you&rsquo;re going to fall behind. With this in mind, I&rsquo;ve kept a healthy approach to improving our branding over the years. Even if you feel like you&rsquo;ve got the perfect branding for your themes, that branding will one day be stylistically out of date you have to keep moving with the times to stay relevant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a great believer in simplifying a process and making it as efficient as possible, whether it&rsquo;s dealing with my company&rsquo;s financials or figuring out the best way to include a plugin in one of my themes. This can and should be applied to building and improving your brand as well. One of the biggest steps I took in doing this was moving over to Visual Composer. This is a fantastic plugin which allows you to design and tweak your themes. It&rsquo;s also highly recommended by ThemeForest itself! Think about it this way, the better your themes are, the more units ThemeForest will sell, so when they give design suggestions, it&rsquo;s important to listen. In the end, they just want you to succeed because you have a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p>With Visual Composer, we were able to refine the design process and put together the visual appearance of our themes with ease. A big part of this was the branding we used. In previous years, if we had wanted to change our branding at some point (which as I suggested previously,</p>
<p>you will have to do in order to keep up with design trends) we had to painstakingly alter each theme&rsquo;s branding to bring them into line with our branding changes. With Visual Composer, we&rsquo;re able to do this much faster with its drag and drop interface. Changing logos, typesets, color schemes and other branding components is simple and easy. I highly recommend Visual Composer for this reason alone, never mind how powerful it is as a design tool.</p>
<p>After years of designing themes, I asked myself at one point &ldquo;why do customers buy our themes?&rdquo;. I began to realise how all of our work on building a personal brand for Stylemix had taken us to new heights and brought about increased sales. People were seeing the <em>StylemixThemes</em> branding and making a purchase just because of that! With this revelation, I began to put more time into our branding once more. We took branding each theme more seriously, and this paid off big time. The more successful our branding, the more persuasive we could be about encouraging customers to get behind our brand and support it.</p>
<p>We also took the time to develop branded plugins which could then be used in other people&rsquo;s themes. These plugins carried the StylemixThemes branding and name, and that meant we were reaching other people&rsquo;s customers and not just our own. Our sales improved massively because of this. For example, one of our most popular products is our Pearl line of themes, which includes 30 website demos for multipurpose and business use. As part of this line, we developed a serious of Pearl branded plugins including Pearl Mega Menu, Slider, and Header Builder. We provided these plugins to the public for free, as well as including documentation and even Youtube tutorials on how to use them. They&rsquo;ve been very popular and have helped us to reach many people we might not have been able to otherwise. </p>
<h2>Going Beyond Your Themes </h2>
<p>When I was looking at StylemixThemes&rsquo; branding and trying to make it as powerful as possible, I realised that our branding had to go beyond just the themes alone. Sure, we could include our name, logo or watermark on theme elements and plugins, but once a site went live there was very little of our branding left. Rightly so, our customers would replace our branding with their own. They could customise our themes from the logos and slogans used, right down to the color scheme. But I knew there were places where our branding still needed to be evident.</p>
<p>One such place was in our documentation. It was important that our documentation had our branding and was in line with the image of our company we wished to convey. That meant including our chosen color schemes and our logos. This proved to be an important step. The reason for this was that our customers would read over the documentation, and in some cases would study it at length. Each time they referred to our documentation they&rsquo;d see the StylemixThemes logo and other branding. And with each exposure to that branding, our customers implicitly connected their websites and their success to our company.</p>
<p>Beyond the documentation, we also discovered some branding opportunities on ThemeForest itself. We ensured that our ThemeForest profile page used colors and an avatar which were in</p>
<p>line with the rest of our brand. Whenever a potential or existing customer then visited our profile page, they were once more influenced by our brand design choices.</p>
<p>Lastly, social media is a powerful tool for any business, but for a theme developer it can be essential. Getting customers, friends, and family to share your themes and other promotional content is a phenomenal way to reach more potential customers. But what are you showing them? We&rsquo;ve been most successful using social media when branding our pages and content so that it&rsquo;s in line with our entire company. That means we watermark our content, post our logo to our avatars, and where possible use the same color scheme as our website. All of this has combined together to create a brand for StylemixThemes which is effective, long-lasting, and leads to continued sales. I encourage you to take the same approach - you will then reap the rewards.</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">How to Select Your Niche</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>
<p>You might already have a good idea about which type of themes you want to sell - but in my experience too many developers jump straight into creating without thinking about <em>niches</em>. In my time building StylemixThemes from a small business to one of the most successful on ThemeForest, I&rsquo;ve discovered that choosing a theme niche or category is just as important as the features, functionality, and style of your end product. There&rsquo;s no point in investing countless hours of development time on a beautiful, effective theme if no one wants to buy it!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Choose the right theme first and you will have taken a massive step towards making your first</em> <em>million dollars on ThemeForest. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this chapter you will learn:</p>
<p>1. The difference between niches and micro-niches.</p>
<p>2. Why everything you do as a developer connects to niche selection.</p>
<p>3. Which niche selection strategies you should avoid.</p>
<p>4. How to pick a profitable niche.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to show you how me and my team go about identifying niches and micro-niches in order to maximise our chances of selling our products. Once you know your niche, the design phase gets so much easier! </p>
<h2>Big Niches Vs Micro-Niches </h2>
<p>When I first started out as a theme designer, I was super enthusiastic about getting started.</p>
<p>Having that enthusiasm is always a great source of strength, especially when overcoming obstacles, but it can also cause you to rush into designing your themes without thinking about who your audience is and why they would want your theme in the first place. This is what I mean by a <em>niche</em>. It&rsquo;s a category of theme.</p>
<p>On ThemeForest, when perusing existing themes, you&rsquo;ll see that all of the available themes are collected together under different category headings. When I first started out, I didn&rsquo;t think too much about this and picked a category without doing the necessary groundwork first. You might strike gold and get lucky with this approach, but I soon discovered that if I just allocated a little time and some of my resources towards researching these categories, then I&rsquo;d have a much better idea about what customers were looking for.</p>
<p>When my first few attempts didn&rsquo;t do so well, I started to put more time into choosing which theme I should develop next. That&rsquo;s when I truly realised the power of niches <em>and</em> micro-niches.</p>
<p>On the ThemeForest Wordpress section, you&rsquo;ll see a selection of categories such as &ldquo;retail&rdquo; and &ldquo;technology&rdquo;. But even those categories are really broad. &ldquo;Retail&rdquo; could mean a clothes shop, a gaming store, a place selling wall art - anything! Likewise, &ldquo;technology&rdquo; covers a huge group of websites like tech news, unboxings, hardware e-sellers - again, anything tech related. I knew it was great to create a theme which could cover a category&rsquo;s needs and be used in a number of situations, but when I started focussing on subsets of each niche, I made far more progress. A theme designed specifically for a clothes shop, for example, has a bigger chance of attracting customers building websites within that micro-niche than a generic theme for retail.</p>
<p>So, I devised a process which involved picking an overall niche and then focussed on a micro-niche within that category. </p>
<h2>Why Niches Are Important </h2>
<p>When I was first looking into which niches I should work with, it wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious why I needed to invest a solid amount of time into choosing the right one for me and my team. Now, after many years of being one of the most successful developers on ThemeForest, I can look back and see just how essential that process was.</p>
<p>Niches are important because they:</p>
<p>● <strong>Focus your attention on one specific area</strong>: Otherwise, you&rsquo;re just taking a scattergun approach which is more like playing the lottery. It&rsquo;s better to have laser focus and chase a defined goal.</p>
<p>● <strong>Reduce your number of failures</strong>: Because you&rsquo;re focussed on choosing niches for valid reason, you are limiting your bad choices and increasing your good ones. This means more successful themes and fewer failures.</p>
<p>● <strong>Establish your reputation</strong>: As you&rsquo;ll see later in this chapter, it&rsquo;s good to pursue different niches over time. However, when you&rsquo;re successful in one niche, such as restaurant themes, you&rsquo;re more likely to attract people within that niche based on your reputation and reviews alone. </p>
<h2>How to Pick the Right Niche </h2>
<p>Knowing that niches are important is only part of the battle. There are so many different theme niches available, how can you distinguish between a niche which will sell and one which will not? When trying to figure all of this out, I didn&rsquo;t have a handbook which pointed me in the right direction, instead I had to go through a long process of trial and error. It took me years of study and hard work to learn which niches were winners and which ones were not, but now I want to pass onto you exactly what I&rsquo;ve learned so you can make a success of yourself so much quicker.</p>
<h2>My First Experiences </h2>
<p>Great journeys often begin in failure. The big difference between a winner and loser is that the winner learns from his or her mistakes and keeps going. When I became a developer, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of categories and micro-niches out there. I had to compose</p>
<p>myself and tackle the problem systematically. Something I had learned at university and through difficult life situations was that a cool head always prevails. By staying calm and looking at niche selection as an opportunity to grow rather than as something to be swamped by, I was able to chart a way forward.</p>
<p>My first approach was to look at two main factors of niche selection: </p>
<p>1. <strong>Global Trends</strong>: This involved using Google searches to see which sort of business niches were trending, and what keywords people were looking for - Google&rsquo;s Keyword Planner is a great tool to help with this, although we didn&rsquo;t have that when I started.</p>
<p>2. <strong>ThemeForest Sales</strong>: Looking at recent trends in ThemeForest sales helped immensely in pointing us in the right direction. Thankfully, ThemeForest lists its most popular themes, their rating, and their sales numbers on their site. That makes researching trends a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explore both of these techniques shortly, as StylemixThemes still uses them with great success. However, despite taking a positive approach early on, there were still difficulties. Our market research was hit and miss. We needed to create a solid way of gathering data about popular themes and demand. Brainstorming sessions with my team also led to disagreements about which niches we should work on, and in the beginning we took a few wrong turns, ending up with several themes which performed adequately, but no more. We wanted big sellers, and that took a change in our approach. </p>
<h2>Moving Up a Gear </h2>
<p>Our initial approach produced some positive benefits, but not nearly enough. We were spending a large amount of time developing themes which we couldn&rsquo;t be sure would sell. Of course there is always a level of the unknown involved in selling anything, but as a company we knew we had to give ourselves the best chance of selling popular themes. We had to box clever with our resources, keep what was working, and either fix or drop what was not. That&rsquo;s just what we did and it paid dividends.</p>
<p>We did the following:</p>
<h2>Negative into Positive </h2>
<p>I believe that every difficulty in life and every problem in business can be turned into a positive outcome. Whether that positive outcome is monetary in the short term or an opportunity to learn, it always leads to a better life and a better product in the future. Taking this attitude, I looked at the themes which hadn&rsquo;t sold as well as I would have liked. Could we salvage anything from them after all of that hard work?</p>
<p>Our Graceland, Revive, and Amber themes didn&rsquo;t sell as well as we would have liked, so we turned them into freebies for our customers. This was a hugely positive move for us. Customers could now try out our themes and see the quality of our work. They could use those themes for free and that in turn created a sense of goodwill for StylemixThemes. Soon, some of those customers would come back and repay us with their loyalty - they would buy our newer themes.</p>
<p>Over time, we created a &ldquo;Freebies&rdquo; section on our website which today includes a range of high quality Wordpress themes and plugins which have helped us to grow our business substantially.</p>
<p>We also realised that we could repurpose what we had learned from some of those themes into different niches. By moving some elements to newer themes, this cut down on development times.</p>
<h2>Improved Our ThemeForest Research </h2>
<p>A big part of our success as a company comes from our researching phase. After having a few themes which didn&rsquo;t sell as much as we would have liked, we pinpointed our market research as the culprit for this. The themes were well designed, but we had misjudged the demand. No matter how good your theme is, if there isn&rsquo;t a demand for it then you won&rsquo;t sell it. That&rsquo;s the harsh reality of selling on ThemeForest.</p>
<p>We needed then to have greater certainty about what would sell and what wouldn&rsquo;t. To do this, we looked at ThemeForest sales again. This time, we built an inventory of strong selling themes on the website. This involved looking at each category independently and then recording which sites performed the best over the previous six months. This gave us a good indication of what was popular at the time. Alongside this, we looked to see how many items in different niches had been added across the previous six months. We then looked at the average sales rate.</p>
<p>Putting all of this together gave us a great indication about the following:</p>
<p>● Which niches were slowing down and becoming saturated.</p>
<p>● Which niches were growing healthily in size.</p>
<p>● Which niches had a stable sales trajectory over a decent amount of time.</p>
<p>Taking all of this data together, my team and I were able to draw up a list of potential candidate niches which looked promising, cutting down the previous scattergun approach. </p>
<h2>Google Keywords &amp; Other Sources </h2>
<p>The sales data we gathered from ThemeForest was exciting, but I wanted to give my company every advantage possible over our competitors. I knew from our previous experience of using Google to do market research that we could get access to sales data other ThemeForest sellers were ignoring. I used Google&rsquo;s keyword planner utility in a more focussed way. I was able to use the trends and sales information from ThemeForest to dig a little deeper when using keywords.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve had a good experience with a cryptocurrency theme called Crypterio. In fact, it&rsquo;s a bestseller for us. But how did we decide to create such a theme? Part of that decision was seeing successful themes from competitors on ThemeForest, but I then used this information to search for keywords on Google about cryptocurrency and found that people were searching for &ldquo;cryptocurrency WordPress themes&rdquo; at a staggering rate. On top of this, we kept our ears to the ground. Seeing developments in the tech world and observing that news sites were talking about cryptocurrency and its future more and more, this led us to further sources which were hyping it up as a valid form of financial investment. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, continues to gain in value at the time of this writing, and in December of 2017 reached a staggering value of almost $20,000 for just one bitcoin. We had to capitalise on that trend. This was an up and coming area we as a team could leverage, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we did.</p>
<p>Social media was also a big plus for us, and helped us see the popularity of cryptocurrency themes. We&rsquo;ll cover this in greater depth in a later chapter, but for now, if you have a number of followers on social media, use polls and surveys to see what people are looking for. One note of caution, however, is to ensure that you don&rsquo;t constantly bombard your social media followers with promotional posts. Mix it up. We have 20,000 followers on Facebook, but we&rsquo;ve realised over the years that our followers want useful, fun information from us through that page. We limit posts about our business to around 1 in 3 or 4, that way customers build a good feeling with us and are more likely to answer survey questions when asked. In the example of cryptocurrency, we were able to look at our own social media chatter and other pages to see how popular this trend was.</p>
<p>By combining Google searches with news and blog sources, alongside our social media and ThemeForest sales data, we were able to get into this area relatively early and make a massive profit on it. Powerful yet simple market research approaches can help you identify niches which are ripe for the picking.</p>
<h2>Better Decision Making </h2>
<p>I spoke earlier about problems during brainstorming sessions. Sometimes our team did not see eye to eye. Some members thought we should adapt one theme over another, while others argued strongly that we should prioritize a different niche. By reaching several impasses, I realised that I had to put in place an efficient approach to brainstorming which would help us navigate these difficult choices as a team.</p>
<p>After identifying several potential micro niches, we set out our golden rule for selection: <strong>Facts</strong> <strong>over opinions</strong>. We all have a gut feeling about which themes are going to work better and produce more sales, but if we only follow our instincts, we are more likely to make costly mistakes. When comparing two different potential niches, we made every development decision based on:</p>
<ul>
<li> Trends</li>
<li> Sales</li>
<li> Growth</li>
<li> Observation</li>
<li> Logic</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing this, we reduced our mistakes, saving us precious time and resources by eliminating themes from our discussions which wouldn&rsquo;t give us the returns we needed. </p>
<h2>Popular Niche Vs Small Install Base </h2>
<p>One of the most common decisions during niche selection which we came up against was whether to choose between a <em>popular nich</em> e or one with a <em>small install base</em>. Many of our competitors always go for designing themes in the most popular niche, but this isn&rsquo;t always the right way to go. I quickly saw that in some cases, a niche with a smaller audience can bring in more profits. Let me explain with an example.</p>
<p>In 2014 and 2015 we designed a theme for restaurant and cafe owners. Why? Because our research showed that three themes in that same niche had been top 10 bestsellers across that time. So, we did what we always did. We researched that niche and designed a feature rich, customisable theme for those customers. It seemed like a no-brainer because the niche had been so popular. But things don&rsquo;t always turn out the way you want.</p>
<p>Despite our hard work with this new theme, we only sold 980 units across that year. In the same time period, we released a micro-niche theme within the Health and Beauty category. Our focus was health and fitness coaches looking to build websites to gain clients. As you can imagine, there are far more restaurants and cafes out there than there are fitness and health coaches wanting to build an online presence. To our surprise, this much smaller niche made a much larger profit for us. We sold over 2,000 units - more than double what the restaurant and cafe niche garnered.</p>
<p>This experience taught me that demand and popularity are not the same thing. A niche can be popular, but it can also be oversaturated. That&rsquo;s why we try to look at how a niche has performed for the previous six months week on week before we decide to develop a theme for it. A niche can sell 20,000 units in six months, but 80% of those sales might come in the first three months, with fewer sales each following month. I realised that a smaller niche with more demand is often the way to go. If you estimate there are only 5,000 customers for a niche on ThemeForest, but no one is offering what they need, it makes more sense to design for those 5,000 customers than for an audience of 30,000 who have mostly already bought and are happy with a theme in that niche.</p>
<h2>Avoid the Worst Strategy </h2>
<p>Lastly, when choosing a niche it&rsquo;s so important to avoid the most common mistake of all. I see it happen all the time, and I encourage you to avoid it at all costs. Too many developers think that to choose the right niche, all they have to do is pick a popular niche, find the most popular theme within that niche, and then simply copy its features and appearance.</p>
<p>This is a terrible strategy. By doing this, you are offering nothing original to your customers.</p>
<p>When we started out, we used to do this and it never worked. I learned the hard way that the best strategy to take advantage of a niche is to give it a unique selling point. To make it better than anyone else and to offer features which competitors have overlooked.</p>
<p>For this reason, before you make your final decision on developing a theme within a specific niche, look at competitors and ask yourself two key questions:</p>
<p>1. Can I offer customers something different than what&rsquo;s already on the market?</p>
<p>2. Can I make a theme which is better than my competitors within this niche?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that if the answer to these questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, then I&rsquo;m definitely on the right track.</p>
<p>This has also been a great learning opportunity for me and my team. When we were first learning about theme development, if we were honest with ourselves that we did not yet have the knowledge or skills to create the best theme within a niche, we&rsquo;d assign some of our development time to learning those skills. This benefited us greatly, increasing our abilities as developers.</p>
<p>You should have a good idea now of how to choose a niche to maximise your chances for success. Failures will still happen, and when they do you can offer those themes as freebies to build an audience. However, my experience is that by being diligent and level-headed, gathering facts over opinions, the successful themes are far more likely.</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">The Theme From Scratch - How We Do It</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>

<p>In my time as a successful developer, I&rsquo;ve realised that designing themes shouldn&rsquo;t be done in a haphazard way. There needs to be an idea or vision at the heart of everything you do, otherwise you&rsquo;ll end up with themes which serve no purpose, are unfocused, and contain redundant features your potential customers don&rsquo;t need. We&rsquo;ve talked about choosing niches and how those niches inform your design choices, and in this chapter I want to take that one step further with you. I want to show you the process I and StylemixThemes have taken when designing themes. These are themes which have been successful, sold thousands of units, and have put StylemixThemes where it is today as one of the top ranked developers on ThemeForest.</p>
<p>In other words, this process will help you create themes which will be successful.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 6:</p>
<p>1. The StylemixThemes&rsquo; approach to building a WordPress theme from scratch.</p>
<p>2. How to think about design considerations.</p>
<p>3. What to do when initial designs do not work as planned.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve split this process into two chapters to make it easier to follow. In this chapter, I want to give an overview of my process up to and including the design stage, and in the next chapter we&rsquo;ll go into greater detail about design secrets every developer should use when creating WordPress themes for ThemeForest.</p>
<h2>Our Process: Simplicity Itself </h2>
<p>Most successful design processes are, at their core, simple ones. They have easily defined steps which you and your team can follow, ensuring that each theme reaches the same level of quality. In my view, this process can be broken down into <strong>9 stages</strong>: </p>
<ol>
<li> Studying Competitor Themes</li>
<li> Creating a Prototype</li>
<li> Mind Mapping Your Theme</li>
<li> Designing Your Theme</li>
<li> Coding</li>
<li> Testing</li>
<li> Designing Item Promos</li>
<li> Uploading to ThemeForest</li>
<li> Marketing</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout my career, I&rsquo;ve honed my process through experience, removing unnecessary stages, until finally settling upon this 9 step process to bringing a theme to life and making it a success. In later chapters we&rsquo;ll discuss stages 5 - 9, but for now, let&rsquo;s focus on the first four.</p>
<h2>Stage 1: Studying Competitor Themes </h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already covered much of this in our niche selection chapters, but it mainly involves looking at what is popular within a chosen niche and studying competitor themes. This provides a good idea of what customers are looking for, and, even better, what they&rsquo;re not getting elsewhere. That way you can create a theme which provides design features customers can&rsquo;t get elsewhere. The best way to do this is to purchase several themes and look at how they work in terms of code, features, and aesthetics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great idea to brainstorm feature ideas once you&rsquo;ve done this. We have regular brainstorming sessions, where the input of StylemixThemes designers and others are taken into serious consideration. It&rsquo;s important here to study the best world practices in your chosen niche, and to write out everything that will make your theme stand out and be popular. Once we have a solid list of the best features we want to include, we then discuss the overall style of the theme so everyone working on it is on the same page.</p>
<p>After this, we then move onto the next stage and build a prototype.</p>
<h2>Stage 2: Creating a Prototype </h2>
<p>Once you have researched the marketplace and have a good idea of what should be included in your chosen niche, it&rsquo;s time to build a prototype. This is a first attempt at creating your theme. It may change significantly throughout the design process or not at all if you hit it out of the park on your first attempt. Our approach is to allow the project manager to create the basic layout.</p>
<p>Alternatively, they can create a list of items which should be incorporated into the homepage and internal pages. After the prototype stage, the design duties are handed over to our web designers.</p>
<p>At StylemixThemes, we use a few tools to develop our prototypes. At first, we always begin with a pencil and paper. Too many people miss this step because they are used to the digital age, but we&rsquo;ve found that doing some rough sketches on paper first really helps us to visualise how the theme layout will look. If you really aren&rsquo;t comfortable with this, you can start out with a graphic editor first.</p>
<p>Once we have a general sketch of what the prototype will look like we move onto using software to further visualize this. We tend to use Adobe Photoshop to create our initial layout, both for the main page of the theme and the internal page layouts. Photoshop also allows us to save in the</p>
<p>.PSD file format which is useful if we need to move the design over to another program. With Photoshop, we&rsquo;re able to create layers and elements which can go straight into our prototype.</p>
<p>To build the prototype, useful tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li> Moqups</li>
<li> Pixate</li>
<li> Flinto</li>
<li> Axure</li>
<li> Justinmind</li>
</ul>
<p>Of all of these, we&rsquo;ve found Flinto and Axure to be the most useful; however, the designer is far more important than the design software, so use what you&rsquo;re comfortable with. What these software packages have in common is that they allow a developer to combine images with animation effects, move around elements while looking at the layout, and then test the results on a smartphone. This speeds up the prototype phase and is much simpler than in the past where prototyping was more laborious.</p>
<p>Sketch is a good alternative for designing interfaces, but our designers do not use sketch. This isn&rsquo;t because Sketch is useless, far from it, it&rsquo;s an excellent utility, but switching over to it would mean transitioning completely to a new system and changing the development process. If you prefer Sketch, go for it!</p>
<p>With regards to the theme&rsquo;s style, we try to have a set idea of each aspect of the theme. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li> The colour combination.</li>
<li> The layout of the blocks and other elements in respect to each other.</li>
<li> Which fonts to use - usually no more than three.</li>
<li> Which graphic elements such as images, photos, and icons will be used.</li>
<li> Input forms.</li>
<li> Any interactive effects or animations and their placement.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Stage 3: Mindmap Your Theme </h2>
<p>By this stage, we always have a good idea of how the theme is supposed to perform and look. I try to incorporate mindmaps into the development as it&rsquo;s a great way to give myself and my team a visual representation of how to make those goals a reality. It&rsquo;s basically a way of mapping out ideas and tasks which flow to each other, providing an excellent overview of what needs to be done and in what order. I highly recommend learning mind maps and using them to organise the design phase. </p>
<h2>Stage 4: Designing Your Theme </h2>
<p>At this point, the designated designer starts to create the theme, doing his or her best to make the prototype into a fully functional finished product. I usually give my designer around two</p>
<p>weeks to get a first attempt together, however, I believe in soft deadlines as unforeseen difficulties can arise with any project. I don&rsquo;t believe in getting severe about these things very often. If a theme requires more time in order to be implemented correctly, then that&rsquo;s the most important thing - that produces great selling themes.</p>
<p>We focus first on the main page. The designer incorporates all of the agreed elements and desired style into the main page, which is then evaluated. Once this is given the go ahead, the remaining pages are replicated based on this by our professional web designer, who quickly draws the missing pages in the relevant style. The smartphone and tablet versions of the theme are usually being developed in parallel with the desktop version. This follows the same process of designing the main page first and then the internal pages.</p>
<p>Finally, any missing elements such as favicons or 404 page errors are prepared and then included in the design. An important consideration is to design the Styling page with all Headings H1-H6, typography, buttons, forms, colors, etc. Throughout this process, some changes may need to be made. We trust our designers to make the correct decisions as they are all extremely talented at what they do. However, if something more fundamental to a theme needs drastically altered, they can get together and organise a brainstorming session with the senior designer and project manager.</p>
<p>When the designer is finished, the theme is then given to the senior designer who looks over the design, and then the project manager reviews it. This ensures we catch any mistakes before a theme is rolled out.</p>
<h2>When a Design Doesn&rsquo;t Work Out </h2>
<p>Sometimes, the design phase won&rsquo;t work out. In fact, you may get to the end of your development cycle and find you have a theme which is either poorly made or doesn&rsquo;t fulfil customer needs. This happened to me in the beginning, and even with the size of StylemixThemes today, it still occasionally happens. It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but not the end of the world. Several times we have decided to stop developing a theme or not release it on ThemeForest for those exact reasons. In those instances I found the theme design to be lacking in some way or the third party plugins we used had limitations which didn&rsquo;t meet our potential customers&rsquo; requirements.</p>
<p>Remember, everything has a silver lining. If you feel you can get the theme to a serviceable level but don&rsquo;t believe people should have to pay for it, then put it on your website as a freebie which will create goodwill for your personal brand.</p>
<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>This takes us to the remaining stages which are <strong>Coding</strong>, <strong>Testing</strong>, <strong>Designing Item Promos</strong>, <strong>Uploading to ThemeForest</strong>, and <strong>Marketing</strong>. I&rsquo;ll be talking more about these in later chapters.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I wanted to give you a general overview of the process I&rsquo;ve developed over the last few years. In the next chapter, we&rsquo;re going further into the designing of themes. I want to pass on my experience and how I discovered the 14 secret ingredients for great theme design.</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">14 Secret Ingredients of Good Theme Design</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>

<p>When we first submitted a theme to ThemeForest, we were shocked when it was initially hard-rejected. I&rsquo;d already been working for some time as a developer, and to good success, so how could a StylemixThemes&rsquo; WordPress theme be rejected so quickly? Not letting this initial setback get me down, I worked tirelessly with my team to amend the theme and submit again.</p>
<p>And yet again it was rejected.</p>
<p>I had to ask myself: &ldquo;Why is this happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon, I discovered with my team that ThemeForest has assessment criteria for each submitted theme. And so, I had to figure out what ThemeForest was looking for and ensure that any theme I was involved in met their requirements. Our number one mistake was that we treated ThemeForest like our old customers. We would work with those customers directly, back and forth, and add or remove features until they were happy with the end product. It&rsquo;s important to realise that ThemeForest doesn&rsquo;t work that way. ThemeForest has its own parameters, but the customers you gain through it often have little web design experience. We had to retrain our entire process, thinking about what a larger number of customers would want in a finished theme, rather than catering it for just one customer like we had done in the past. We then made the mistake of overloading our themes with features, trying to keep everyone happy.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;ve said before, a sleek, efficient design will always sell better.</p>
<p>While there is no universal recipe for the perfect design which will always be accepted or sell well, since the early days I have developed a list of 14 secret ingredients which when applied massively improve the chances of ThemeForest accepting a theme, and for it to sell a good number of units.</p>
<p>Now I want to pass this research onto you. During your prototype and design stages, be mindful of including these important ingredients and you will have great success.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 7:</p>
<p>1. Which design issues are most important.</p>
<p>2. How to balance these issues to create an effective theme.</p>
<p>3. How to organize your project, thinking about updates and deadlines.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #1: Unity of Style and Features </h2>
<p>Ensure that your style and features support each other. There should be a consistency throughout a theme so that it has the same aesthetic throughout, and that the features serve a purpose for your customers in line with that look. Whatever that style, and whatever those</p>
<p>features are, is down to you. If you&rsquo;re building a theme for a gardening niche, then you might think about a look which has a natural freshness to it. Alongside this, you might include plugins which support embedded video and images in a way that people can showcase whatever they&rsquo;re growing. See how there is a unity of style and features there?</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #2: Be a Universal Soldier </h2>
<p>By a &ldquo;Universal Soldier&rdquo;, I mean that as a developer you don&rsquo;t want a theme to be so specific that it serves too few customers. I always strive to create themes which service a niche, but have a good level of customisation so that customers have the power to shape their website the way they choose. I often call this the $100 bill rule. Everyone likes $100, and in the same way everyone should like your theme as well. Make them all happy!</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #3: Minimalism </h2>
<p>Minimalism is a popular design trend, and it&rsquo;s one I encourage you to embrace. It is a philosophy of living life and/or design which means that you should keep everything as functional and as &ldquo;pure&rdquo; as possible. This creates great focus. I always do my best to put the content first and to ensure that the design focusses any user on the content a client wishes to display.</p>
<p>The basic features of minimalism are simplicity of forms, clarity, and accuracy of composition.</p>
<p>Attention is placed on the &ldquo;main thing&rdquo;, whatever is at the core of a page. Anything which is unnecessary gets cut off. This creates a neat, sleek design which doesn&rsquo;t overload someone looking at your theme with information. They get what they need from the page as quickly and as effortlessly as possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that a theme should be boring, on the contrary. Minimalism is about getting rid of redundancy and focussing on important elements.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #4: Include Photos </h2>
<p>At StylemixThemes, we understand the power of photos. When used correctly, they can leave a very strong impression on the design of a theme. When I was studying my competitors on ThemeForest, I was amazed to see so many developers not spending any time on the photos they were choosing for their themes. It appeared to me that they were simply throwing up the first stock photo they could find. This is not the way to go.</p>
<p>As a company, we went in a different direction. For the team at StylemixThemes, random stock images just won&rsquo;t do. Why? Because we know that when potential customers are browsing our themes, the images we include <em>matter. </em> They have a deep effect on the look of our themes and the message they convey. Boring stock photos with a generic business person smiling like a Cheshire Cat, makes a theme look like any other.</p>
<p>Instead, we used sources like unsplash.com, where we source natural looking photos which create a more welcoming and sincere vibe to our themes. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that those images will be replaced by the customer with their own, what matters is the enticing effect this has on whether someone buys our theme. Unsplash.com provides us with lively people and faces instead of models sitting in robotic poses.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #5: The Right Icons </h2>
<p>Alongside any photos you want to include should be the right icons. We learned quickly that using Font awesome icons was a bad idea, as they&rsquo;re just read as text. They are boring! Even though they were once popular, we&rsquo;ve found that customers prefer custom made icons. We assertively adapt our sets of icons to each theme, keeping in mind the unity of style we&rsquo;re looking for. If we don&rsquo;t have an icon we can adapt, then we&rsquo;re lucky to be able to create them from scratch. This gives each StylemixThemes product an original, individual look. In some instances we do buy icons ready made, but if you&rsquo;re going down this route, it&rsquo;s my experience that you need to read any documentation and licensing agreement carefully. Never use an icon without an author&rsquo;s consent or outside of the author&rsquo;s license. This will give you a bad reputation as a plagiarist.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #6: Expressive Typography </h2>
<p>I see a lot of developers agonizing over font choice. I can understand why. The right font choice can make a theme perfect, the wrong font choice can make a theme unreadable, and who would want to buy an unreadable theme? I believe that font use is endowed with the powerful potential to evoke the strongest associations for a theme, just as a photo or image can. Fonts can express what the designer intends, and so artistically are an essential piece of good WordPress design.</p>
<p>After years of developing themes, I&rsquo;ve found that skyfonts.com is the best program to find the correct font for your theme. Using this, I find that no more than 2-3 fonts are best on any given theme. Any more and you risk cluttering your design and getting away from minimalism. As a rule, I&rsquo;d say one font for headings, and another for the main text are essential. Perhaps one more for another page element, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>At StylemixThemes, we&rsquo;ve found that font choice is all about experimentation. We try different ones out until we settle on the best ones. As long as they fit the unity of style and are easily readable, then they are a good fit. If you have a flat design, expressive typography is a great way to grab a visitor&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #7: Think About Trends </h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about trends already, so no need to go too much over this. All I would like to add is that I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to view trends as inherently unstable. Just as quickly as they can rise up and become popular, they can flounder. I am always prepared for this. For example, our</p>
<p>Crypterio theme depends entirely on the success and interest in cryptocurrency. Can we control that as a company? No! So I don&rsquo;t stress too much about it and understand that some themes have their moment in the sun before tapering off in terms of public interest.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really interesting is that trends within design itself fluctuate. New technologies evolve, and new design approaches become fashionable. What we try to do is use design approaches which seem to be around for the long haul. Of course, we experiment and follow trends, and use them when necessary. We have experimented with futuristic fonts in our universal Pearl theme, for example. There are some general aspects of design that we stick to as rules such as using serif fonts for training themes, which has always been well received by clients in the past.</p>
<p>In the end, experiment with trends in design, look for new opportunities and stay relevant, but focus most of all on quality work.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #8: Responsive Design </h2>
<p>Responsiveness is so important. Clean and simple, flat designs have become popular in design circles because they run smoothly and can be easily adapted to mobile phones and tablets. If a site requires heavy resources to run, it will scare off the mobile audience. Bearing in mind that there is an all-time growth in mobile traffic, the last thing you want is for a theme to be sluggish on a mobile device and give up this massive audience. Also, Google now ranks websites which use Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) technology higher in their search results. Keep your designs responsive and customers will thank you for it, as their websites will be much more visible.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #9: Living Sites </h2>
<p>Modern browsers have the technology to display exciting, complex animations. This attracts the attention of customers and does not require heavy resources to make an impact. It&rsquo;s a great way for a theme to display a product/service as quickly as possible with minimum text. Most importantly, this type of visual content is well remembered. With just one glance the client will recall your brand.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come to realize that dynamic visuals are a great way to make a complex pitch understandable. It&rsquo;s the same reason video is so popular. If you want to tell a story about your theme, and provide your customers with the same tools to display their own animations, then this is the way to go. It&rsquo;s easy to go overboard, however, so don&rsquo;t overload your theme with them.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #10: Color Combination </h2>
<p>Early on in my career, color selection became a profound design ingredient, and it&rsquo;s been that way ever since. Along with elegant typography, natural images, and unique content; good color choice creates harmony and consistency which customers value. This isn&rsquo;t just about the</p>
<p>aesthetic of a theme, good color choice can make a page easier to read and navigate. Poor color choice can result in a bad experience.</p>
<p>If you look at the StylemixThemes&rsquo; portfolio, you won&rsquo;t find a purely black theme. That&rsquo;s because switching from purely black to a white background when browsing the internet can strain the eyes of your customers. I&rsquo;ve found that nature provides more than enough inspiration for color choices. For instance, black and yellow are found on bees, but they work great for themes conveying danger of some description. Experiment with such colors. Useful resources for selecting color palettes include:</p>
<p><a href="https://colordrop.io">https://colordrop.io/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://uigradients.com/#Friday">https://uigradients.com/#Friday</a></p>
<p><a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel </a></p>
<p>You can sometimes break the mold as well. Our best-selling Consulting theme is rebellious and uses color combinations like blue and yellow, which rarely occur in nature. Experiment!</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #11: Deadlines </h2>
<p>As I mentioned in the previous chapter, at StylemixThemes we&rsquo;re not too strict about deadlines.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll set them, but if it means a theme can be all it can be, we&rsquo;ll extend them for the designer.</p>
<p>We value and appreciate self-development and therefore do not drive creative people into such a false framework. It&rsquo;s my belief that posting hard deadlines stifles creativity.</p>
<p>When it comes to programming, timing is more clearly defined. We still try to be flexible, though.</p>
<p>We also give a margin of error of 10 - 15% to any deadline we do set down. In my experience, this approach has gotten the best results from my team in terms of quality of work and output.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #12: Content is King </h2>
<p>In the early days of WordPress development, themes were often seen with lorem ipsum generic text. But when a potential customer sees that, I think they&rsquo;re entitled to ask &ldquo;what the &hellip; does this mean, damn it?&rdquo;. Thankfully, but the end of 2017, it became common practice for theme developers to have good content in place to showcase what their themes look like when used.</p>
<p>If you do not have someone who is great at writing, I highly recommend using a site like Upwork to hire a professional copywriter to do that for you. Your theme will look far more professional and finished. At StylemixThemes, we use thematic texts, carefully create content, and always display this with correct formatting. You might think these are small details, but there&rsquo;s no such thing in theme development. Any edge you can get you need to grab hold of with both hands.</p>
<p>Seeing the &ldquo;small&rdquo; details come together gives me great satisfaction as a developer.</p>
<p>An example of this approach can be found with our Consulting theme. It was a top seller for 2.5</p>
<p>years and sold over 10,000 units. We wrote unique content for it, and that paid off.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #13: Updates Are Critical </h2>
<p>Continual updates are so important. I&rsquo;ve seen customers turned off from an excellent theme simply because it had not been updated for over a year. Customers want to see that you care about your themes and continually improve upon them. Then they can buy with confidence.</p>
<p>Updates do allow you to fix bugs, but they are about so much more than that. We love producing new demos of our themes while improving functionality and improving features.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to update about once a week. Once you have many themes to work on as a team, you can do what we do, which is use a calendar plan where updates are clearly schedule for each of the themes you sell. We produce updates for 14 themes on a regular basis, and that matters to our customers.</p>
<h2>Secret Ingredient #14: Steal, As an Artist </h2>
<p>We have a corporate rule - &ldquo;Steal, as an artist&rdquo;. But what does that mean? Surely stealing isn&rsquo;t good? Of course it isn&rsquo;t. But when it comes to creativity, what I mean is be <em>influenced</em> by other people's&rsquo; works. In a world where nothing is unique, why reject this influence? Especially if you can collect ideas!</p>
<p>Eagerly absorb anything which resonates with your imagination. Books, paintings, movies, music, photos, dreams, nature, architecture - you&rsquo;ll be amazed where you can draw influence from when designing WordPress themes. For our team, we&rsquo;ve found computer games and travel to be wonderful inspirational sources for our design process. Our team wheels around the globe regularly, so all of that cultural mix is fantastic and nourishes the creative spirit.</p>
<p>This does not mean simply copying existing themes. I can&rsquo;t stress that enough. It&rsquo;s a common practice, but this is not creativity. Instead, look at themes you admire in a niche and then think about how you can apply some of those ideas in a niche of your own. It is better to focus on your own ideas and establish a successful theme in a different niche, infusing it with your influences, and charting your own course. Sure, it&rsquo;s a risk, but the potential prize is worth the uncertainty. You&rsquo;ll make a theme you can be proud of, and one you would even buy yourself!</p>
<p>Pride in your work is essential. Passion leads to success.</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">Technical Support & Updating Themes</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>

<p>Many of the developers I&rsquo;ve encountered in my time using ThemeForest have made the same critical mistake: They believe that once a theme is designed and sold, that&rsquo;s their job done. This is too simple an approach. It focuses on designing and marketing a theme, but says nothing for support and future updates. Tech support and the continual updating of your themes is a cornerstone of success on ThemeForest. This is true for any tech business. A staggering<a href="https://www.gladly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017_Customer_Service_Expectations-Survey_Gladly_Final.pdf"> 78% </a><a href="https://www.gladly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017_Customer_Service_Expectations-Survey_Gladly_Final.pdf">of customers </a>purchase a brand or service because of their support experiences, and a whopping<a href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/205445/silver-lining-customer-problems.aspx?g_source=WWWV7HP&amp;g_medium=topic&amp;g_campaign=tiles">&nbsp;93% of people </a>are only satisfied with their support experience when they feel trusted and valued by a business. You can see then just how important good support techniques are.</p>
<p>Now, enough of the stats. In this chapter I&rsquo;m going to take you through my journey of developing a great support and update service when selling themes. Learn from my experiences and you can leapfrog the competition in this area.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 8:</p>
<p>1. How to value support.</p>
<p>2. StylemixThemes&rsquo; support ethos.</p>
<p>3. How to update your theme regularly to please customers.</p>
<h2>Learning to Value Support </h2>
<p>The most important support lesson I have learned is this: Be a good parent. What I mean by this is that when you give birth to a fantastic theme, no matter how good it is, your job is only half done. Sticking to the birth analogy, think about it this way - everyone likes to have sex. Well, most do. And for some, the end product is a baby which produces an incredible feeling of joy.</p>
<p>After this, parents tend to fall into one of three categories:</p>
<p>● They dedicate themselves to ensuring the baby grows up to be a loved and resilient adult.</p>
<p>● They stick around but do the bare minimum and don&rsquo;t care most of the time.</p>
<p>● They run for the hills!</p>
<p>On ThemeForest, you want to be a good parent. If you look after your theme once it&rsquo;s out in the world, you&rsquo;ll reap the rewards. If you do the bare minimum or abandon any support after selling it, your business will suffer - and so will your sales! Like a teacher giving your kid a terrible report card, customers will review your theme poorly, and they&rsquo;ll be unlikely to want to purchase anything from you in the future.</p>
<p>So, be a good parent. Always. It&rsquo;s not easy. Teaching a baby about the world requires a lot of work. It&rsquo;s a daily grind. No matter how proud you are of the baby or how much you love it, you&rsquo;ll still have monotonous, difficult days. But as the child grows up and gains momentum, they&rsquo;ll show how important all your hard work and input was. It&rsquo;s the same with a theme. All your hard work supporting and updating your themes will produce great and rewarding results.</p>
<h2>The Early Stage of Support </h2>
<p>Another thing I learned which helped immensely to develop a rewarding support experience for my customers, was just how critical the early stages of support are. When you&rsquo;re first trying to establish yourself as a theme developer on ThemeForest or you&rsquo;ve just released your new baby into the world, getting support right early on is so important.</p>
<p>The trick is to take item support seriously.</p>
<p>As developers, we&rsquo;re all happy when a theme or plugin (let&rsquo;s call them &ldquo;items&rdquo;) gets published on the marketplace. But as soon as that item is published, you have to immediately turn your attention to customer support. You&rsquo;ve done all the hard work of choosing a niche, researching the necessary features, and implementing them into a sleek design, but once you&rsquo;ve sold just one unit, you&rsquo;re already in the support and update game.</p>
<p>A big part of this is the item rating system. At this early stage, you have to give yourself the best chance of avoiding negative reviews and garnering positive ones. At StylemixThemes, we learned through trial and error that focussing on solid, productive support procedures straight away was one of the best ways to get those golden reviews. We knew that getting good reviews early would create a buzz about our themes and our brand. This would attract more customers, who we would likewise provide a first class support service to, and this would snowball until the sales were rolling in.</p>
<h2>Dealing with Negative Reviews</h2>
<p>A negative review can scupper this early growth; however, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world. There are ways you can deal with them. Remember, I&rsquo;ve learned to value turning a negative into a positive in my time as a developer, and it&rsquo;s worked for me and my company. Try to find a silver lining. We&rsquo;ve found the following to be important when dealing with negative reviews:</p>
<p> 1. <strong>Being Honest</strong>: I encourage my team to be honest and not defensive over negative reviews, the rare times they happen. Ask yourself the question, does the comment have merit? Is the criticism valid? Look at the theme and decide whether it needs updated in order to avoid the same criticism from other customers. Continually revise until those reviews cease.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Unhelpful Criticism</strong>: Very occasionally, a customer will review a theme unfairly. Their comment will be an attack on you and your team. Alternatively, it might just say that your theme is poor, offering no value as a review to you as a developer or prospective customers as buyers. In this case, you can contact Envato&rsquo;s Support service. Let them know about the negative review and that it is either unreasonable or doesn&rsquo;t have a detailed explanation as to why the reviewer didn&rsquo;t like the theme. In those cases, Envato&rsquo;s support team will remove the review from your profile. Another reason to love ThemeForest!</p>
<h2>A Good Support Approach </h2>
<p>So, what makes a good support approach? How can you best nurture your theme after you&rsquo;ve produced it and released it into the world? This is an open ended question. Different developers have different approaches, but at StylemixThemes, we&rsquo;ve spent years learning from customer feedback and refining our support procedures to blow away the competition. Our customers remain satisfied with their expectations for support often exceeded. That&rsquo;s why we continue to be one of the most popular developers in the marketplace. I now want to pass on what I&rsquo;ve learned as a developer and what my team has learned in terms of customer support.</p>
<h2>The StylemixThemes Tech Support Strategy </h2>
<p>Try the following:</p>
<p>● <strong>Lay the Foundation</strong>: First you have to assign your support team. In the beginning it might just be yourself who has to deal with all support queries, but it really helps to be able to have at least one person on your team who&rsquo;s entire job description is to handle support issues. Also, assess how much time you need to put towards support. In our experience it&rsquo;s a continual process, but if you&rsquo;re always handling support and not releasing new themes, then you&rsquo;re standing still. Try to find a balance so that customers receive a prompt response, but that you still push forward as a developer at the same time. </p>
<p>● <strong>Be Responsive</strong>: Speaking of responsiveness, never let a comment go unanswered.</p>
<p>Ensure that you or your support staff take the time to answer every single comment on a theme&rsquo;s profile page. This creates a reputation for being attentive to customer needs, and it actually cuts down on support times overall. If you can answer a support query on a theme&rsquo;s comment section, then other&rsquo;s with a similar issue will read that comment and have their issues resolved without needing to contact you for further assistance. </p>
<p>● <strong>Be Polite</strong>: Customers will not always be polite with you. Occasionally, a customer can be downright nasty towards a developer. However, I&rsquo;ve learned that it&rsquo;s best to instruct your team to always maintain a friendly, professional tone when handling customer comments and queries. People will see you and your team behaving with incredible patience and reliability, and this will only improve your reputation as a developer. </p>
<p>● <strong>Always Meet Customer Needs</strong>: As well as being polite and helpful, we always do our best to satisfy each and every customer. They have paid for your product, and so it&rsquo;s a point of pride among the StylemixThemes team to ensure customers are delighted with their purchase. This again earns you a good reputation and leads to more sales. Surely putting up with a few grumpy customers is worth that? </p>
<p>● <strong>Create Bugs and Features Lists</strong>: Look on your customers as the best quality assurance testers out there. Whether it&rsquo;s a plugin or a theme, your customers will put your items through rigorous testing, using them in ways you otherwise might not have anticipated. When this happens, there are bound to be a few bugs. Write down every bug and the number of times those bugs have appeared independently for your customers. This gives you a useful list to work through when updating your theme.</p>
<p>Likewise, customers will find certain features lacking or request a specific feature&rsquo;s inclusion in future updates. Create a features list to work from, noting how many customers request such a feature. </p>
<h2>How Much is Too Much Support? </h2>
<p>Early on, you&rsquo;ll probably have to split your time between developing new themes and supporting existing ones. It&rsquo;s essential you get that balance right. However, once you have the available team members and resources, I highly recommend offering 24/7 support. Being able to offer continuous support is what most of our customers at StylemixThemes value. Whether you can do this or not will depend on the number of sales you&rsquo;re making each month. I&rsquo;d recommend waiting until you have about 300 sales per month before considering offering 24/7 technical support. You should be able to afford the support costs with those sales.</p>
<p>We currently have one senior support manager who supervises our support team which consists of three other staff. They split the working day between them, which means there&rsquo;s always someone answering support queries night and day for our company.</p>
<h2>Speed of Response </h2>
<p>In my opinion, the speed with which you respond to customer issues is paramount. Our customers love that they receive an instant response through our various means of communication. Even if they receive a polite automated response, they know our staff are there and will be with them ASAP. Remember what I said about customers needing feel valued and trusted at the beginning of this chapter? How quickly you respond to customers helps each of them to feel valued by them. Their experience is important, and they will appreciate you valuing that, just as StylemixThemes does. </p>
<h2>How Best to Offer Support </h2>
<p>There are a number of ways to communicate with your customers. How you choose to do this is up to you, but in my experience, a combination of methods is the best approach. However you decide to let your customers contact you, it has to be easy and reliable. Otherwise, the customer experience will suffer. And when they are already frustrated with having to ask for support, the last thing you want to do is add to that frustration and get a bad review.</p>
<p>At StylemixThemes, we use the following means of communication:</p>
<p>● <strong>Live Chat</strong>: This text system allows our support staff to interact quickly and discreetly with customers. Our support managers are always available through this chat method, so it&rsquo;s a great way to offer assistance to our customers. </p>
<p>● <strong>ThemeForest Comments</strong>: As I said above, answering all the comments on a theme&rsquo;s profile page is important. It&rsquo;s a great way to offer support and cuts down on support queries. Support staff answer these. </p>
<p>● <strong>Forums</strong>: Another excellent way to speak with our customers has been having a forum for theme to give us their opinions on our themes. Our support staff monitors the forums daily. </p>
<p>● <strong>Ticket System</strong>: A ticket system allows customers to log issues with us, which they receive a ticket for in return. When we look at that ticket and try to resolve that issue, we get back in touch with the customer. Currently, we have two tiers of tickets. Tier 1 involves easy support problems which can be resolved by regular support managers.</p>
<p>Tier 2 involves more complex issues which our Senior Support Manager deals with.</p>
<p>Finally, if neither of these tiers can deal with a support query, it&rsquo;s passed on to our Chief Technology Officer (CTO) who should be able to resolve it. </p>
<h2>Updating Your Theme </h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m often asked when is the best time to update your theme? On my journey as a developer, I&rsquo;ve learned that there is a sweet spot. Update your theme too often and you&rsquo;ll end up with a pile of new bugs you have to sort through, which can be overwhelming. Update too little, and you look like a parent who has abandoned their child. Worse still, you&rsquo;ve taken money for them from a stranger and then abandoned your offspring on their doorstep!</p>
<h2>When to Update </h2>
<p>Think back to the bugs and features lists I suggested you write. These are you blueprints for continued success. Using these lists as a guide, an update can incorporate bugs fixes and/or feature updates/additions. Bugs fixes are usually more time critical. If a customer is trying to use your theme in a specific way and it&rsquo;s not working, you want to roll that bugfix out as soon as possible. The sooner the better, in fact! When it comes to feature requests, however, I would recommend that you wait until you have had at least 10 separate requests for said feature before implementing it in an update. </p>
<h2>Plan Ahead </h2>
<p>Bugs and feature requests can come in thick and fast. It&rsquo;s easy to become overwhelmed, and in my experience the only solution to this is to take a systematic approach. You need a plan. It&rsquo;s important to plan your theme update in accordance with your available resources. Some feature requests might be too big for your team, it&rsquo;s up to you to plan which features will be included in an update and who should carry those additions out.</p>
<p>At StylemixThemes, we&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s so important for the developer who knows the theme best to carry out the updates. Some developers will disagree with this. They&rsquo;ll assign their updates to a different section of their team, but to me this is a big mistake. In my team, the developer who created the theme has to do the theme updates in the future. This is because:</p> 
<p>1. That developer knows the theme better than anyone else.</p>
<p>2. That developer will ensure future features are in complete alignment with the purpose and design of the theme.</p>
<p>3. That developer will be most interested in getting the initial design as right as possible to limit the amount of &ldquo;boring&rdquo; updates they&rsquo;ll need to do in the future.</p>
<p>4. That developer will want to nurture their own work and make sure it is as good as possible. They&rsquo;re invested in a theme more than anyone.</p>
<h2>An Update or New Theme? </h2>
<p>At this stage, you should decide whether the number of feature requests merits a new theme or not. In some instances, you might decide that you can create a second theme in that niche which meets customer demands. What I will say, however, is that based on my experience, I prefer to enhance a current theme instead of creating newer ones in the same niche. By staying invested in the older theme, you&rsquo;re showing your customers that you really care about their purchase and want their experience to be as positive as possible.</p>
<p>If you think you&rsquo;re existing theme isn&rsquo;t cutting it in terms of sales and are tempted to make a new one, try to salvage the situation first. Don&rsquo;t be afraid! You can boost your existing theme using awesome marketing tools. We&rsquo;ll discuss those in a later chapter.</p>
<h2>How to Publish Your Update </h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve carried out your updates, you need to go through a reliable process to have those updates published. At StylemixThemes, we&rsquo;ve found that developing an internal review and approval process is the best way to do this. This allows us to ensure that any changes made by our team work and meet the rigorous standards we&rsquo;ve set for ourselves. It would be terrible to send out an update which actually made a theme worse, rather than better. We&rsquo;re diligent in making certain this doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Our process looks like this:</p>
<p>1. The developer update the theme/plugin based on the Update list prepared by Project Manager.</p>
<p>2. Our Quality Assurance Tester receives the update and goes over the theme ensuring it works as intended, and is to our standards.</p>
<p>3. Our CTO then looks at the update.</p>
<p>4. This is followed by a web designer (who designed this theme) and senior designer who evaluates the update for public consumption.</p>
<p>5. Finally, our Project Manager double checks the demo and theme.</p>
<p>6. If everything checks out, the update is uploaded to ThemeForest and existing customers are automatically notified of the new features/bug fixes.</p>
<p>As you can see, the update and support stages of any theme are important, but if you follow our approach, you&rsquo;ll soon have a long line of satisfied customers who know that you will continue to support a theme long after its initial release.</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">How to Make a Profit on Tech Support</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>

<p>As a developer and entrepreneur, I&rsquo;ve learned that it&rsquo;s problematic if you don&rsquo;t take advantage of available revenue streams. The developer who generates a more expansive and stable income will outlast competitors and continue to grow healthily. Without this, you&rsquo;re not maximizing your potential. It&rsquo;s that important. So many developers on ThemeForest are unaware of the serious income you can generate from tech support alone. Though it&rsquo;s not a passive income and requires work, by monetizing part of the tech support you offer, you can significantly boost your revenue. This is especially critical if your sales vary in the beginning and you need to rely on other sources of income. It can be a lifesaver. However, if you try to monetize all of your tech support, you&rsquo;ll not only violate Envato&rsquo;s terms of service, but you&rsquo;ll also turn buying customers into irate ones.</p>
<p>In my experience, you need to find a balance between monetizing just enough that you can generate supplemental revenue, but not too much that your customers feel taken advantage of.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I want to take you through how I figured out how to achieve this and pass these tips onto you.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 9:</p>
<p>1. How to monetize tech support.</p>
<p>2. When not to charge customers.</p>
<p>3. StylemixThemes&rsquo; guide to monetization</p>
<h2>How I realised Tech Support Should be Monetized </h2>
<p>At the beginning of my journey as a developer, I offered free WordPress installs of each theme I sold. That seemed like a logical step to me. For starters, many of the people buying these themes would surely know how to install them themselves and therefore not take us up on the offer. Secondly, by offering this service free of charge, I could get a headstart on my competitors by giving my customers that little something extra. I also felt that we would minimise support queries from customers if we took care of the initial install and setup ourselves.</p>
<p>This was a solid strategy to begin with; however, I quickly realised that offering this type of tech support free of charge caused issues. Our company wasn&rsquo;t even on ThemeForest yet at that point, and we were a small team. Each morning I would wake up to 10-15 requests for free installs. As you can imagine, I had to fulfil those orders since I had advertised this offer. But it was time consuming. The more requests I received, the less time I had to research other niches, design new themes, or even market them. On top of that, those requests ate into my</p>
<p>team&rsquo;s available time to answer smaller support requests and bug reports - an essential part of good support.</p>
<p><em>I had to make a change. </em></p>
<p>First, I was bold and removed the offer of free installs for customers. It was a difficult decision, but it immediately made a big impact in terms of the available time and resources we had at our disposal to move the business forward and take care of day to day tasks. Second of all, we fulfilled all outstanding requests for free installs from existing customers, as well as committing to continue free installs for those who bought their theme before we removed the offer. If we hadn&rsquo;t done that, the negative word of mouth could have killed our business. Even at that early stage, we dedicated ourselves to making each of our customers happy and would not compromise on that goal.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we would still offer free installs to any customer asking for a refund. The reason for this is that most refund requests came from customers who were not well versed in WordPress and did not understand how to install their theme on a web host. When we offered free installs privately to those customers, the refund requests would usually be cancelled and those customers would be very happy. Everyone won out of that situation.</p>
<p>After taking care of the free installs issue, we were still receiving support queries from some customers which went well beyond smaller support requests such as bug and general feature requests. That&rsquo;s when I had my eureka moment and realised that I could monetize these larger requests. At this point I still had to figure out exactly which of those queries to monetize and how to go about charging customers.</p>
<h2>When Not to Charge Customers </h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what you shouldn&rsquo;t charge for. By this point I had formed StylemixThemes into a formidable ThemeForest developer. Deciding which tech support queries to monetize therefore was informed by Envato&rsquo;s terms of service. Familiarising myself with the terms of service, it became clear what we shouldn&rsquo;t monetize.</p>
<p>Envato has a strict quality assurance process when you upload your items to ThemeForest, so that helps cut down on support times had you launched a theme that had some glaring issues without their oversight. However, Envato&rsquo;s tech support standards go beyond that. When you sign up with ThemeForest, they ensure that the following is provided to customers free of charge:</p>
<p>● All future updates and amendments made to a theme by the developer.</p>
<p>● That the developer ensures they are available to answer customer queries about any theme they have uploaded.</p>
<p>● The developer must offer general assistance and endeavour to correct reported bugs and issues.</p>
<p>● You must also help customers with any third party assets such as plugins which you have included in a theme.</p>
<p>If you attempted to monetize any of these services while using ThemeForest then your account could be suspended or banned. All of this must therefore be offered as standard. When I learned this, I therefore took the time to ensure that not only were our support procedures in place to offer these services promptly via ThemeForest, but spoke with my team members making certain they understood what was required of them when these types of customer support requests came in.</p>
<p>Bugs and general feature requests/updates therefore should not be monetized.</p>
<p>I asked myself at this point: &ldquo;what about bespoke theme customizations and installs?&rdquo; I already knew that installs could take up a solid amount of resources when given for free, but what if they were monetized? And could my team offer customers customizations to themes tailored to their specific needs?</p>
<p>The answer was a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; however, I had to be very careful not to fall foul of Envato&rsquo;s terms of service. With some planning, I figured out the perfect way to monetize this element of tech support, creating happy customers and gaining a foothold in an important revenue market.</p>
<h2>The StylemixThemes Guide to Monetizing Tech Support </h2>
<p>I knew that the Envato terms of service tied your hands as a developer when it came to charging customers for extra services. A theme sale had to be a one time purchase through Envato with no way to directly offer customers other commercial services. One loophole was that Envato allowed the developer of a theme to forward theme installation or customization requests to third party customers. This was my gateway to monetizing extensive support requests, and it can be yours, too.</p>
<p>After a lot of research, I listed my options for this type of monetization. Let&rsquo;s take a look at each.</p>
<h2>Affiliate Referrals</h2>
<p>The quickest way to start making money from customization and install requests was to use affiliate marketing. This is a technique used in almost every business sector to generate a passive stream of income. All you have to do is refer each customer request to another business. That business then carries out the work and when they charge the customer, you receive a small amount of the proceeds. It&rsquo;s quick and easy to set up and you don&rsquo;t have to allocate resources for customizations or do the work yourself. The downside is that you don&rsquo;t make nearly as much money - your cut is pretty small.</p>
<p>There are several agencies who do custom WordPress jobs such as wpcurve.com and wpsitecare.com. It&rsquo;s easy to get set up and because your developer business isn&rsquo;t doing the work, you&rsquo;re not violating Envato terms of services by referring customers this way.</p>
<p>StylemixThemes went a different way, which we&rsquo;ll discuss below, but this is a great way to quickly make some additional revenue from customization and install queries.</p>
<h2>Envato Studio </h2>
<p>Another option to monetize these requests was to use Envato Studio. This is another website service Envato offers and it&rsquo;s a great way for some developers to make extra money. Envato Studio is essentially a job marketplace. It has a community of hand-picked designers, developers, and other digital freelancers dedicated to helping customers customize their WordPress installs. Customers can even find video producers there to take their websites to the next level, so it&rsquo;s a great fit for people wanting a bespoke vision for their WordPress site.</p>
<p>We became one of those developers and used Envato Studio for some time, generating at least $2,000 per month on customization orders. However, it does have its problems as a service. For example, you cannot refer work to another Envato account, you have to use your main account to carry out all work. Second of all, every single request made to Envato Studio must be answered within 12 hours. If you are assigned a query, you have to accept or decline the job within 12 hours or your account will be deactivated. You must then go through Envato Support to get your account reactivated, which is a time drain and frustrating. There is no option to assign different people to your Envato Studio profile because it&rsquo;s using your global Envato account for this. Thus, I couldn&rsquo;t share access to my main account with other people in my team for security reasons.</p>
<p>In the end, I made the decision to discontinue my use of Envato Studio for the above reasons. It was frustrating that I could not assign a manager on a different account to the tasks we received and had to micro manage the entire process. I also felt uncomfortable sharing my main account with anyone because that account contains all of my financial data. While I decided that this wasn&rsquo;t the way to go for StylemixThemes, it&rsquo;s certainly worth considering for those who don&rsquo;t have an issue with these problems or are just starting out.</p>
<h2>Another Company </h2>
<p>It soon dawned on me that I had already laid the groundwork for monetizing customization requests, and in a way which didn&rsquo;t violate Envato&rsquo;s terms of use. As I mentioned at the beginning of this book, I had started out as a developer outside of ThemeForest. When I came to producing themes for ThemeForest, I created StylemixThemes, a brand new company.</p>
<p>But what of the old company, Stylemix LLC?</p>
<p>It was perfectly situated to handle these customization and install requests. Because the company had a completely different branding, I was able to refer any customer looking to have</p>
<p>their site installed for them, or have one of our themes altered specifically for their needs, to the older company.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that everything followed Envato&rsquo;s guidelines to the letter, it wasn&rsquo;t just a case of referring customization work to my old company while using the same team members.</p>
<p>Instead, I made sure that those working for the old company did not do work directly under the StylemixThemes branding. With all of this in place, we were able to monetize theme customization and install requests, making substantially more than we would have had we used affiliate marketing or Envato Studio.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an old company outside of ThemeForest like I did, this shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>
<p>You can quickly create a new company with its own branding and staff. You can then refer your customers to that company when needed. One word of caution, however. In my experience you will need at least one manager to supervise and one front-end or full stack developer working for the other company. A full stack developer is preferential as they can deal with front-end and back-end tasks.</p>
<p>As long as you keep both companies legitimately and legally separate, then you are still referring the work to a third party. This is the approach I&rsquo;ve taken and it&rsquo;s created new revenue streams and exciting opportunities for both companies. Whichever way you decide to go, I strongly urge you to think about monetizing this type of tech support so that you can earn more and keep your customers working with you rather than lining the pockets of a competitor.</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">Working with Staff and a Team</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>


<p>When you start out as a developer, unless you are lucky to have a great group around you and the resources to fund them, you&rsquo;ll be on your own. Working on your own has its merits - building something from the ground up is rewarding itself - but the time will come, and hopefully quickly, when you will need to hire people to meet the growing demand for your themes. Support staff, marketers, designers, admin etc. are an essential part of any successful Wordpress developer, so the sooner you know how to get the most out of your staff, creating a good team dynamic, the better for you and your business.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: From the first person you hire, your experience as a developer will change. Having to nurture and work with other people as a leader can be a trying task. But despite this, my experiences have led me to value people and talent even more so than the themes StylemixThemes has produced. Get the right people in and treat them well, and you will sell many themes on ThemeForest.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 10:</p>
<p>1. Why working with a team is important as a developer.</p>
<p>2. Effective team strategies when working as a team.</p>
<p>3. Which tools will help you form a more cohesive team.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Work in a Team </h2>
<p>When I first started out as a developer, I knew early on that I wanted to create a team environment to work on themes. One of the main reasons for this was that I found working alone to be boring and tedious. It was exciting at first, but after doing this for a year or two, most developers crave to work more collaboratively with people. There&rsquo;s an excitement in that. When I first put my team together, I was enthralled by how much could be achieved as opposed to working on my own, and I&rsquo;ve never changed this opinion.</p>
<p>Being in a team let&rsquo;s you be part of something so much bigger than yourself. New ideas that you wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of are produced by your staff, and in return, you provide innovative ideas of your own. When designing themes, this gives you a pool of talent and design choices which you wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise. You can then pick from the best ideas and create themes which are a cut above the competition, especially when many of them are single developers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that single developers don&rsquo;t have their place. Because of the success of StylemixThemes, we&rsquo;re inundated with applications from developers wanting to work with us. Of course, we can&rsquo;t employee all of these individuals, but we maximise our talent pool. All of the StylemixThemes team work full time and in-house for us, but we&rsquo;ll also help single developers who have talent to bring their themes to the next level. We even help sell them and then share</p>
<p>the profits. We get access to talent and they get access to our reputation and sales, it&rsquo;s a win-win!</p>
<p>Another reason you should consider working in or with a team is that you can progress together as individuals. When there are more of you, spreading the load, you&rsquo;ll have more free time to hone your skills as a developer. If there&rsquo;s something new that you want to learn, then you might be able to learn it from a more experienced staff member. At StylemixThemes we continually encourage the personal development of our staff members, and they really appreciate the opportunities we create for them to learn and grow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolute pleasure to work with a great team, and the camaraderie and talent pool you will gain access to make it extremely advantageous to be part of one. But how do you create the perfect team? What should you take into consideration when hiring and maintaining your company&rsquo;s relations with its employees? Let&rsquo;s take a look at that now.</p>
<h2>Good Team Strategies </h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that creating a good team environment as a developer is all about your approach.</p>
<p>The most important thing you need is determination and the ability to make difficult choices.</p>
<p>One of the most trying elements of putting a team together for me initially was to find reliable people! This is especially true when starting out, as you might not be as good at identifying the best people for a job, and even if you can you might not be able to afford them. Take time to interview and source as many applicants as you can, and offer trial periods so that if it doesn&rsquo;t work out, you can easily terminate a contract without any problems. Working with a team is like anything else, the more you do it the better you get at it!</p>
<h2>Problem Employees </h2>
<p>When working with other people, you need to be serious about your intellectual property. When working alone, you&rsquo;re hardly going to steal from yourself! But when others are involved, unfortunately, it happens. Early on, I had a bad experience when one of my former developers used the training and expertise we gave him to steal and use code we had created for our themes. I had no other option but to file a DMCA takedown through Envato, who blocked the sale of the stolen theme. The developer then tried to be sneaky and altered the code a little and resubmitted to get around the ban. To protect my and my team&rsquo;s hard work, I had to file a claim<a href="http://www.net-arb.com/">on www.net-arb.com. </a> This site arbitrated on my behalf once I paid the fee. Once they looked into the code, they produced all the documents for Envato, declaring that even with the small changes, my former developer had stolen my intellectual property. Envato were great and blocked the stolen theme from being sold forever!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, most people are honest, but you have to protect yourself. I&rsquo;ve found having non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with each of my employees to be the best way to protect myself from this happening again. It&rsquo;s a legally binding document that each staff member must sign before being hired. It stipulates that they cannot use any element of our themes outside of our company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also had bad experiences outside of plagiarism. Too many examples in the early days, unfortunately. One comes to mind when a member of the support team who had to be fired because of his behaviour. He would then call in drunk, threatening me with legal action unless I hired him again. But the positive, nurturing atmosphere of my team was paramount to me, so I refused him, knowing full well what my rights as an employer were.</p>
<h2>Motivation </h2>
<p>Keeping your team motivated is a difficult task, especially when you&rsquo;ve been working together for a long time. It&rsquo;s natural for people to slow down or become less passionate about projects over time, but as an employer, you have to see complacency as the enemy. I have a saying about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Stay hungry, stay foolish</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s two parts to this saying. The first is that I always aim to keep my staff passionate about producing great themes. They need to desire the work. The second part is that I want them to be foolish. I want them to take chances on new ideas and innovations. I want them to be happy and have fun. If I do my job, then my staff should consistently remain hungry for success, always striving to make new ideas a reality. They should also have fun at work! Every Monday and Friday we have a team meeting where we go through the tasks for each employee and make sure everyone is doing well and on track to reach established goals. Then, once a month, we have a team-building event. This can be paintball, soccer, PUBG, or even a PS4 FIFA-tournament. We even went on a holiday to Turkey together one month!</p>
<p>At all times I remind my team about the goals we have for the current year, and make sure they are rewarded for reaching them and producing consistent quality work. I don&rsquo;t put too much pressure on my team. If a deadline is going to be missed in the short term, that&rsquo;s okay. After a week, we all agree that those working on overdue projects should be penalised 1% of their salary for each business day until the work is completed. I allocate 10% each month for bonuses and also present gifts for outstanding achievements. I decide who will be given a prize each month after talking with our CTO, Senior Support Manager, and Senior Designer.</p>
<p>My main point here is to be fair, make your work environment a positive one, and reward great work. As a result, your team will remain hungry and foolish, creating themes which kick ass on ThemeForest. </p>
<h2>Listen </h2>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one lasting piece of advice I can give in this chapter, it&rsquo;s that the best thing you can do when working with a team is <em>listen</em>. This comes from experience. Too many managers and business owners believe they have all the answers. If you employee the right people, they&rsquo;ll have answers too, and on some occasions they&rsquo;ll have even better ones to offer. That&rsquo;s why we do weekly brainstorming sessions on our themes. We listen to what people have to say, paying close attention to new ideas and how they might pan out if we implement them. I give each small team working on a theme one week for research so they can adequately tell us what they feel is required to produce a brilliant theme in a specific niche. We are constantly working on new themes, so it&rsquo;s a continual influx of ideas. The managers I&rsquo;ve hired for each department are told how important it is to listen to the designers and support staff. They are the feet on the ground, if there&rsquo;s an issue with how we do something, they often know about it first.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that every point made should be implemented, but it will make your team feel valued if they know you are listening.</p>
<p>Listening is also key to handling staff disputes. This could be anything from workload issues, to personal problems affecting work, to series issues between staff members. In order to keep a fun, healthy environment from degenerating into acrimony, it&rsquo;s important to listen to issues people have. When this happens at StylemixThemes, I try to deal with it first by helping staff members reconcile, but if there are more deep rooted issues, we have a staff psychologist who specialises in handling conflict.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always open to staff queries, and we encourage our team to communicate through text messenger and regular meetings at all times.</p>
<h2>The Right Tools</h2>
<p>Finally, if you are working with your team, make sure you have the right tools in place. Cloud project management is a must. This let&rsquo;s a large number of people work on one project, ensuring that everyone is on the same page. We use Trello, which is very well designed to handle team projects. This let&rsquo;s us list new features, desired goals, new ideas, and keep a record for each theme of what needs done. Using Trello, each theme has its own board, and then this is split into smaller boards covering the different elements of the project. I highly recommend using this or a similar service. It will bring your team closer together.</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">Updating Price Point for Envato Market</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>

<p>Envato is a wonderful market for developers. It provides access to a huge buying audience and is easily one of the best places to get started. Despite this, however, there are some issues that you should be aware of which are largely out of your control - issues which you will need to think about and respond to strategically. Primary among these is Envato&rsquo;s price policy. The price at which you sell your themes will determine in part your sales numbers, and your growth as a developer. Pricing is also inherently connected to quality. But Envato has altered its price policy recently, and it has brought a number of advantages and disadvantages for developers.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of these, as well as a possible solution to this problem.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 11:</p>
<p>1. How Envato&rsquo;s price policy works.</p>
<p>2. What price dumping is and why it is happening.</p>
<p>3. A solution to low theme prices.</p>
<h2>Envato&rsquo;s Changing Price Policy </h2>
<p>Just last year, Envato announced a profound shift in its pricing policy. The reverberations of which are still being felt at the time of this writing, and will continue to be important for some time to come. It&rsquo;s certainly affected us at StylemixThemes. This change in business strategy by Envato altered how theme prices are decided. You see, originally, the price point of any theme on ThemeForest was set by Envato&rsquo;s review team. They would look at your theme and decide what a fair price for it was. With this new change, developers are now able to set the price point for their themes themselves.</p>
<p>This sounds like a great idea in theory, putting the power in each entrepreneur&rsquo;s hands, but the direct result of this is that profits have decreased. For us at StylemixThemes, our earnings fell from $2,100 per day to $1,200. That&rsquo;s a 42% decrease! Sure, $1,200 a day is still excellent for a developer, but you&rsquo;d be mad not to be concerned about this dip. And we&rsquo;re not the only ones who have been affected. I&rsquo;ve spoken to several other high profile developers and they&rsquo;ve all seen a similar decrease in earnings since Envato allowed developers to choose their price point.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the reason for this fall?</p>
<h2>Why Price Dumping is Happening </h2>
<p>Competition between developers on Envato has always been tough, but it&rsquo;s also always been fair. Knowing that the Envato review team would judge and set each theme&rsquo;s price based on its quality, meant that developers always strived to make the highest quality themes they could.</p>
<p>This resulted in Envato showcasing premium quality themes for customers, and at a price where developers could make a very high profit on each sale. Now, this has changed. Even low quality themes can chart high on Envato&rsquo;s sales rankings because they can set their own price point.</p>
<p>This is a race to the bottom, with developers undercutting each other in order to increase the volume of their sales. But it&rsquo;s a double edged sword. Sure, as a new developer, it's a good way to chart on the sales rankings quickly and make some money, but at a much lower profit per unit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that Envato has done this in order to encourage new developers to make a profit quickly. This seems like a good idea at first, as developers can sustain themselves more readily if they have access to sales revenue early on. For us at StylemixThemes, we had to work for those sales rankings when we started in 2011. It meant we didn&rsquo;t get access to large sales instantaneously, but the flip side was that it gave us time to hone our skills, become better developers, and build a reputation for quality themes - all because we had to learn how to make the best themes possible to compete, and this encouraged innovation. Now all you need to do is lower your price: It&rsquo;s now competition of price point, not quality. This is what new developers are up against, and it can be disheartening if you take pride in your work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that this &ldquo;price dumping&rdquo; is not productive for Envato or its users. Yes, ThemeForest should find ways to help new developers establish themselves, but very soon price dumping will lead to poorer and poorer themes for a cheaper bottom line. This will negatively affect the reputation of Envato among the WordPress community and customers. Selling your items for $19, for example, will mean you can&rsquo;t put the resources towards updating it consistently, nor will you be able to provide adequate customer support for your themes.</p>
<p><em>Customers may look outside of ThemeForest for quality themes. </em></p>
<h2>Is ThemeForest Worried and Concerned About Authors? </h2>
<p>Like any business, Envato is most interested in its profit margin. If they feel they can create a larger profit by allowing this price dump across the board, rather than for just budget themes, then they will do so. But this runs counter to how themes are now made. It&rsquo;s no longer a simple process requiring small amounts of time and resources. Quality themes in a competitive market now require:</p>
<p>● Developing &ldquo;must have&rdquo; features.</p>
<p>● Including premium plugins.</p>
<p>● Quality of code according to Envato standards.</p>
<p>● Analysis of new development practices.</p>
<p>● Understanding and researching design trends.</p>
<p>● Implementation of innovation.</p>
<p>All of the above requires new assets which you the developer must buy or create. That takes time and money, something developers will increasingly feel isn&rsquo;t worth the time considering the falling profit margins on Envato.</p>
<p>Yes, Envato will sell far more themes if they cost just $19 per unit, but in the long run it will ruin competition. Because of different standards of living, only developers from poorer countries will remain on the platform because they will be able to live off of these smaller margins and justify support investment. That means a large part of the developer community will be locked out. This will significantly reduce diversity and quality.</p>
<p>That being said, I firmly believe that you still require good skills to succeed as a developer on ThemeForest, and for the moment, it is still a fantastic place to create a successful developer business. I&rsquo;m also heavily in favour of fair and healthy pricing to nurture innovation. Of course, the primitive price reductions currently being used by Envato&rsquo;s new price policy are boosting sales, but in the long term it is counter productive. I personally do not want Envato to become a dumping ground for low-quality products made with minimum effort, and providing developers with a minimum return.</p>
<h2>How Dangerous Are Low Prices? </h2>
<p>Low prices are disastrous for theme developers. They demonstrably cheapen the end product, the creativity involved, and the customer experience in the long term.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve been working on a theme for 2-3 months. To compete with your competitors who are using Envato&rsquo;s new pricing policy to lower their prices, you cut the price of your themes accordingly. But you aren&rsquo;t making enough money because you&rsquo;ve gone as low as $19 per theme. When you do this, your sales increased - this is what happens in the majority of cases.</p>
<p>However, in order to maintain quality and offer good support and updates, you need a larger profit margin, so you then raise the price back up to $39 or even $59. What happens?</p>
<p>Immediately, your sales drop. This happens in 99% of cases, and so you feel forced to chase the low price point, limiting the amount of resources you allocate towards the theme because it&rsquo;s not worthwhile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you bought a H&amp;M t-shirt for $5, you wouldn&rsquo;t be focussing too much on the quality -</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d just be focussing on how affordable it is. Likewise, customers purchasing $19 themes aren&rsquo;t looking at the quality, they&rsquo;re just focussing on how little it costs. If, on the other hand, you bought a Hugo Boss t-shirt for $100, you&rsquo;d expect to get value for that. If it was a poorly made t-shirt, you&rsquo;d be annoyed having paid so much for it! Customers feel the same about themes. If a theme costs a lot, they expect more in return. So, as a developer, you have to take this price point into account at all times. The more you charge, the more features and support you should include. You therefore have to be strategic and invest more time and resources in premium themes, while your budget themes should be well made but more limited in scope. If customers want more, they&rsquo;ll pay more.</p>
<p>Envato doesn&rsquo;t need low prices, and it&rsquo;s a mistake that the platform is chasing these. Still you have to be aware of this to see what you&rsquo;re up against. Other marketplaces like creativemarket.com or templatemonster.com have kept their themes in the $70 range. That&rsquo;s much higher than on Envato, but it has ensured a level of quality. Be mindful of pricing conventions and think through how best to function as a developer - should a theme be budget priced with fewer resources or higher priced with more features and support?</p>
<h2>A Possible Solution </h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom. There is light at the end of the tunnel. There are ways Envato can both provide lower price points and maintain quality. These are my suggestions:</p> 
<p>1. Envato could add a lower threshold for prices which newer authors cannot go below, and a different lower limit for Elite Author and Power Elite Authors using ThemeForest. This continues to reward premium design, but will give customers access to cheaper themes with less quality and support, designed by newer developers. I think a good lower threshold price point would be $29 for themes by new authors and $39 for Elite and Power Elite Authors.</p>
<p>2. Envato could also create a new ranking/Top List for &lsquo;Popular Newbies&rsquo;. This would showcase the best selling themes from new developers for the previous 7 days.</p>
<p>Established developers and leading market players such as Avada, BeTheme, and StylemixThemes, would not feature on this list. This would give new developers a budget theme space to reach new customers without having to compete with established developers, while not affecting the premium listings for seasoned veterans.</p>
<p>Envato is a great service, and has many wonderful opportunities associated with it, but I&rsquo;d love to see it embrace my suggested changes. What do you guys think?</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">Recommended Plugins and Builders</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>

<p>One of the most important features of the WordPress CMS, is that it allows you as a developer to use third party plugins. By using these, you can quickly add a large number of features to your theme, instantly increasing its scope and value. While this plugin system is incredibly useful, there are so many plugins available to you as a developer that choosing the right one can be a bit overwhelming. At StylemixThemes, we&rsquo;ve found the correct use of plugins to be instrumental in our success. In this chapter, we&rsquo;re going to explore my approach for researching and selecting plugins in order to make your themes as effective as possible.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 12:</p>
<p>1. Why plugins are essential when designing WordPress themes.</p>
<p>2. How to pick the right plugin for your theme.</p>
<p>3. How to handle compatibility issues.</p>
<p>4. Why you should consider using a WordPress builder.</p>
<p>5. Which builders work best.</p>
<h2>Why Plugins Are Essential </h2>
<p>When I first started out using WordPress, I learned the power of plugins quickly. The main reasons they are essential is that they <em>cut down on time</em> and <em>provide your customers with</em> <em>options</em>. Your time as a developer is such an important resource, so you while you don&rsquo;t want to cut corners, you do want to find effective ways of achieving your design goals in a shorter time.</p>
<p>This will help you produce better quality themes more readily. Plugins save you time because you don&rsquo;t need to program a feature from the ground up. If you&rsquo;re looking for the right slider for a theme, for example, you can simply look through available slider plugins, install one and you&rsquo;re off to a great start! The plugins also provide your customers with a simple way to customize your theme to their needs.</p>
<p>The only problem you have to solve is, <em>how do I know I&rsquo;ve picked the right plugin? </em></p>
<h2>Picking the Right Plugin </h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that taking a little time to select the right plugin saves you a whole lot of corrections down the line. It&rsquo;s good to factor in this research time into your overall theme development cycle, and in the long run this will shorten development time.</p>
<p><em>So, how do you go about selecting the right plugin? </em></p>

<p>Let me share my process with you. First of all, you are looking for plugins which serve three purposes:</p>
<p>1. They effectively solve a problem for your customers.</p>
<p>2. They are simple to install and use.</p>
<p>3. They blend in with a theme&rsquo;s design aesthetic.</p>
<p>You should know what you are aiming for before you start looking at plugin selections. Have a clear, defined concept of why you need a plugin. If you only have a vague idea, then you are more likely to install several plugins, which will result in a bloated theme. Remember, <em>minimalism! </em></p>
<p>There are a number of great places to find plugins, but at StylemixThemes we stick mostly to Wordpress.org and Codecanyon.net. You&rsquo;ll find free plugins at the former and paid plugins at the latter. Most free plugins are great because you can use them in commercial projects without paying anything. Be cautious about paid plugins, as there can be hidden costs in terms of how many units you sell. There are usually licensing agreements and limitations which must be fulfilled if you are going to use a paid plugin. The best way to negotiate these is to contact the owner of the paid plugin and get in writing that you can use the plugin for an agreed fee.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t overstress the point - <em>be careful about paid plugins</em>. Envato has the right to disable a theme and remove it from sale if a plugin owner complains about the misuse of their plugin.</p>
<p>Worse than that, Envato can even delete your entire account, which would be a disaster. If you have to use a paid plugin, ensure that your agreement with the plugin owner is air tight.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you should be able to find what you&rsquo;re looking for in Wordpress.org&rsquo;s free selections. The community of designers who provide these free plugins is filled with talent.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m looking for a plugin, I make sure to use plugins with at least a 4 star rating - no lower!</p>
<p>I also make sure a plugin has a good number of reviews, which let&rsquo;s me know that it is reliable.</p>
<p>A good benchmark is around 30 - 45 reviews resulting in an accumulative rating of 4 stars or more.</p>
<p>I will try out a few different options to see which one fits my design purposes best. There are usually several options available for each potential feature in a theme, so spend a little time trying them out - it&rsquo;s a bit like test driving a car. A car might look the part, but drive terribly, so it&rsquo;s best to experience what it&rsquo;s like behind the wheel, first hand. Better that than letting your customers crash!</p>
<p>Lastly, remember to stay innovative. Some plugins were released a long time ago. Keep informed about new design trends and plugin features. Make sure they are secure and up to date.</p>
<h2>What to Do When Things Go Wrong </h2>
<p>Even with this approach, I&rsquo;ve had things go wrong. Sometimes you can use a plugin and, despite being thorough, there&rsquo;s a problem which presents itself after you&rsquo;ve started selling your theme. Yes, it&rsquo;s a nightmare, but we wake up from those eventually - everything can be fixed.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some common problems.</p>
<h2>Compatibility </h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating when you love two plugins but they refuse to work properly together. It&rsquo;s a bit like getting stuck between two friends arguing. Not pleasant. To solve this problem, ask yourself which plugin is more important to your design. Also, consider how long it would take to make the plugins work together. At StylemixThemes, sometimes we amend free plugins and add the features we need or iron out the bugs, if we think the end result will be worth it.</p>
<p>In some situations, you&rsquo;ll have no alternative but to abandon one plugin for another. Hopefully, you&rsquo;ll find another plugin which will provide similar features, but never compromise a theme&rsquo;s functionality and appearance because you love a plugin so much. Writers are often encouraged to &ldquo;kill their darlings&rdquo;. That means editing out the piece of writing they love the most if it compromises the overall story. You need to do the same as a theme developer in some circumstances. <em>Kill your darlings</em> and remove plugins/features if it means the theme will be better for it.</p>
<h2>Licensing Issues </h2>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said previously, take licensing issues seriously. We ended up in a difficult situation once because of a licensing disagreement and it caused my company a real headache. We included a plugin with our Crypterio theme. Everything seemed fine as we had purchased an extended license in order to use the plugin. We thought that such a license would cover us for bundling the plugin with our theme. But we were wrong. The author of the plugin filed a DMCA takedown against us and, after just two weeks of sales, our Crypterio theme was disabled by Envato.</p>
<p>If you have a disagreement with the plugin owner after releasing a theme, try your best to negotiate. Whether that means paying more money or using the plugin in a different way, that will be down to you and the plugin author. In some cases, however, the owner of a plugin will simply not budge. That happened with our Crypterio theme, and so we had no option but to remove the plugin. Thankfully, we then resubmitted the theme and it was approved by Envato, minus the plugin.</p>
<p>No plugin or feature is worth risking your business over!</p>
<h2>Must Have Plugins </h2>
<p>Over time, you will come to discover your <em>must have</em> plugins. These are the plugins you will return to time and time again when developing themes. I recommend putting together a list of plugins you can use in this way. They will provide a solid foundation for your themes. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you are married to them and must always include them, but it does mean that you have a suite of plugins you can install to quickly create the basis for a theme if needed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a level of trial and error for you, but in my experience, I&rsquo;d recommend focussing on the following plugins to create your own must have list:</p>
<p>● Image Sliders (we use Revolution Slider) as a clean way to display content throughout a website or on the homepage.</p>
<p>● Mega Menu plugins to create beautiful, easy to use menus for navigation.</p>
<p>● Fancybox, to customise the look of your theme.</p>
<p>● Page builders to effortlessly create page demos.</p>
<p>Your list may end up being more extensive, and you could also create custom must have plugin lists for types of themes, but either way, this is a great way to create a quick foundation for your development cycle.</p>
<h2>On Builders </h2>
<p>Before we close this chapter, I&rsquo;d like to talk briefly about page builders. These are a special category of WordPress plugin which have proved transformative for StylemixThemes. Using a builder makes it easier to create demos of a page for testing purposes. We design variations of a single section (about, news, testimonials, how it works etc.) and then we have access to a large library of modules to be used with a theme.</p>
<p>This is a huge time saver and let&rsquo;s you see your design coming together piece by piece, allowing you to identify problems quickly, and hopefully find the solutions just as fast. You&rsquo;ll bundle a builder plugin with your theme so that your customers can have those same advantages when customizing it.</p>
<h2>Which Builder? </h2>
<p>Like any plugin category, there are a large number of builder options. I recommend trying a few out to see which you feel most comfortable with, just make sure that the builder plugin has good reviews and is regularly updated. At StylemixThemes, we use WPBakery Page Builder and another builder called Elementor. Both are excellent. WP Bakery is a premium builder and requires you to purchase an extended license. Unfortunately, this only covers one theme, so you need to buy a new license each time you intend on using it for a new theme. It is great, though! Elementor is a free page builder which you can use as much as you want. Both builders have many addon modules which allow you to increase functionality from the base plugin.</p>
<p>An important point is that many freelancers already know how to use WP Bakery. That means that when they are thinking about buying your theme and it includes a builder they are familiar with, they know they don&rsquo;t have to learn anything new. This is a huge selling point. For this reason, I&rsquo;d recommend sticking with a well known builder if you are including it as part of your theme bundle. This strategy has increased our sales at StylemixThemes.</p>
<h2>Builder Issues </h2>
<p>Like any plugin, a page builder can also cause problems. In 2012 before we moved to WP Bakery and Elementor, we used Live Composer. At the time, this builder had a short term spike in popularity, so it seemed like a safe bet. We released three themes after this using Live Composer, but after a few years the author decided to no longer support the plugin and actually removed it from Codecanyon.net. This left us with three themes which had an unsupported page builder, meaning that fewer and fewer people were going to learn that page builder, which would result in fewer sales for us.</p>
<p>We had to act fast, and so we considered a few options. These were:</p> 
<p>1. Update the builder for each theme ourselves.</p>
<p>2. Recode the theme with a new builder like Visual Composer/</p>
<p>3. Leave the theme up with the old builder and receive negative reviews.</p>
<p>4. Remove the theme from the marketplace.</p>
<p>After performing manual updates of the builder over a few months, we calculated the revenue we were making on the themes. It ended up not being reasonable to invest time recoding the themes in the long term. For this reason, and to avoid the negative reviews which would hurt our brand, we made the difficult decision to remove the themes entirely.</p>
<p>Always put your long term reputation as a developer first. This will benefit you in the long run and help grow your business.</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">Things You Need to Check Before Uploading</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>

<p>Like any creator, it&rsquo;s important that you do a final check through before you release your product into the wild. The last thing you want is for your theme to receive a large number of negative reviews because you didn&rsquo;t check that it was up to a high standard before uploading. Likewise, Envato also has certain stipulations which each theme must meet before being listed on their services. In this chapter, I&rsquo;m going to share with you my checklist process which ensures I&rsquo;m uploading as good a theme as possible while also meeting Envato&rsquo;s guidelines. Bear in mind, this chapter is merely an overview to help you get started - I&rsquo;ve included links to resources which go into each section in far more depth.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 13:</p>
<p>1. StylemixThemes&rsquo; ultimate theme checklist.</p>
<p>2. How to check WordPress requirements.</p>
<p>3. How to test your theme.</p>
<p>4. Useful tools for checking your theme.</p>
<h2>The StylemixThemes Checklist </h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken us a while to develop our own checklist, but I feel it&rsquo;s a great foundation for any developer wanting to release themes to a high standard. Of course, you may feel that you need to alter some things to suit your own needs and expectations, but hopefully my experiences and the experiences of my team should save you a lot of time by sharing this with you.</p>
<p>Our checklist is broken down into the following points:</p>
<p>1. Theme Unit Test</p>
<p>2. WordPress Requirements</p>
<p>3. Envato Theme Check</p>
<p>4. Markup Validation</p>
<p>Each section of our checklist contains critical information and ideas for producing high quality themes, so I highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with each. Let&rsquo;s now take a look at each.</p>
<h2>Theme Unit Test </h2>
<p>Before we upload to Envato we first perform a Theme Unit Test. This allows you to create an export of your theme which can then be imported into a WordPress installation. This is beyond a mockup; the theme unit test creates a working version of your theme which you can then</p>
<p>interact with and test just as a customer would, to ensure that when it&rsquo;s released into the wild that if performs exactly as you want it to. I would recommend that you do not <em>only</em> perform this step and then upload your theme to Envato. The theme unit test stage, while incredibly helpful, is only the beginning of the test phase of your project. We&rsquo;re all keen to see our themes released, especially when they are complete, but cutting corners during the test phase can be disastrous.</p>
<p>The Theme Unit Test phase will test the install of a theme and how it functions when installed.</p>
<p>Much of this involves going over specific aspects of your theme such as the static front page, your 404 page, and your blog posts index page, as well as others. You&rsquo;ll want to ensure that each page and its features work correctly. This might seem laborious, but it doesn&rsquo;t actually take all that long, and the fact that it can identify unforeseen issues makes it highly necessary.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find a great overview of the Theme Unit Test phase at <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test">https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test. </a> This will also be kept up to date as WordPress evolves, so keep an eye on this and look for changes whenever you are getting ready to test a new theme.</p>
<h2>Checking WordPress Requirements </h2>
<p>After the Theme Unit Test phase is complete and you&rsquo;re happy with how everything looks and functions, it&rsquo;s time to check your theme complies with Envato&rsquo;s WordPress requirements. This stage involves a series of checks to ensure that your theme is safe and reliable, and that any included third party content or plugins functions effectively.</p>
<p>There are six elements you should check during this stage. These are: <strong>Feature Requirements </strong> </p>
<p>Envato requires that the features of your WordPress themes must meet their guidelines. A full list of these requirements can be found at<a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000480723"> https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-</a><a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000480723">us/articles/360000480723. </a></p>
<p>They break these requirements into seven types:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Core Features</strong>: These are the first aspects of your theme you should check in terms of Envato&rsquo;s guidelines. They include things like the presence of comments, sidebars, and home pages.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Core Settings</strong>: As well as what is present, those features must abide by Envato&rsquo;s WordPress Core Settings requirements such as not creating a custom setting for a theme or feature if a similar one already exists in WordPress&rsquo;s main core.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Sidebars and Content Areas</strong>: A few guidelines for how content areas should behave, such as ensuring that demo content is not hardcoded into template files.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Menu Position</strong>: How your menus and sub menus appear.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Customizer</strong>: This covers requirements for incorporating the WordPress Customizer into your themes. The Customizer is an API which allows users to live preview any changes they have made to their site. You can find out more about the customizer, here -<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/">https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/ </a></p>
<p>6. <strong>Child Themes</strong>: Incorporating a child theme which has all of the features and style of a parent theme but can be modified without affecting the parent theme&rsquo;s files, is a great option for your customers. However, Envato has strict guidelines about how you should use such a theme.</p>
<p>7. <strong>WooCommerce Templates</strong>: WooCommerce is a very popular eCommerce plugin for WordPress users, but its functions must be standardized and secure due to the processing of financial records. Envato warns developers to never remove WooCommerce template hooks from modified core templates and instead recommends that developers use the available features of WooCommerce rather than attempting to modify them in any way.</p>
<h3>Plugin Requirements</h3>
<p>There are thousands of plugins on the market, some of which are more reliable and secure than others. In order to ensure that its listed products function correctly, Envato has developed a checklist for incorporating plugins into your theme. These can be studied at your leisure in greater detail at<a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000481223"> https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000481223. </a></p>
<p>This is broken down into:</p>
<p>● <strong>Plugin Territory Functionality: </strong>Envato differentiates between presentation and content. Anything which involves content creation and function rather than appearance, must be handled via a plugin. This is now compulsory. </p>

<p>● <strong>Third Party Plugins &amp; Libraries: </strong>Any libraries and scripts which are included with a theme must follow Envato&rsquo;s WordPress Requirements guidelines which can be found at</p>
<p><a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000510603">https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000510603. </a> As a developer, you must keep included plugins and libraries up to date, ensure that the plugin works with the latest WordPress release, and if you choose to modify a plugin, you must get written permission from the plugin owner first. If you do make changes, you are personally responsible for bugs and fixes. </p>
<p>● <strong>Plugin Inclusion</strong>: If you include a third party plugin, you must use TGM Plugin Activation or a TGM Plugin Activation based solution. This is a library which helps theme developers through installing, updating, and activating chosen plugins. You can read more about the TGM Plugin Activation library at<a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/"> http://tgmpluginactivation.com/ </a>There are also other plugin requirements, so ensure that you are familiar with these at <a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000481223">https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000481223. </a></p>
<p>● <strong>Out of the Box</strong>: It&rsquo;s a requirement that your theme <em>must</em> still function and work &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; before any included plugins are activated. Your theme must be able to do everything that a basic WordPress installation can without the included plugins. It must also have a similar, if not identical, style and appearance to the demo you included on Envato before plugin activation.</p>
<p>● <strong>Checking for Plugins</strong>: Envato has guidelines for checking that a plugin is active, which can be read here -<a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/checking-dependent-plugin-active/"> https://pippinsplugins.com/checking-dependent-plugin-active/ </a>The main point is to avoid using the <em>is_plugin_active()</em> command, as Envato has deemed this check to be unreliable. Instead, developers are encouraged to use the <em>function_eists() </em> or <em>class_exists() </em> commands. </p>
<p>● <strong>Import &amp; Export Plugin</strong>: If you are going to incorporate an importer plugin into your theme which will alter the content somehow, you must make sure that the user has been given a clear warning about this change before it happens. Any custom importer must use the WordPress Filesystem API. </p>
<p>● <strong>Health Check Utilities</strong>: If your theme comes bundled with a built-in server health/theme requirements utility, then this function should only be made available to users with <em>switch_themes</em> capability for security purposes. </p>
<p>Remember, this is just an overview of Envato&rsquo;s plugin requirements, be sure to read their extensive guidelines at<a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000481223"> https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000481223. </a></p>
<h3>Coding Requirements</h3>
<p>The coding of your theme must adhere to Envato&rsquo;s rules. Generally speaking, this means that no unused code fragments, comments, or todo lists should be present in the code, unless they are used to explain an aspect of the theme to the user. You must also sure that the code for your theme is easily accessible and not hidden in any way such as through base64 encoding.</p>
<p>The coding requirements are extensive. I would recommend studying them before you begin coding your theme. That way, you won&rsquo;t waste a large amount of time correcting for Envato&rsquo;s guidelines during the checklist phase. You can find all of the coding guidelines at</p>
<p><a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000479946">https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000479946 </a>which includes coding for Prefixing, Loading FIles, WordPress Code, PHP Code, HTML/CSS Code, JavaScript Code, and ensuring that your code is translation ready.</p>
<h3>Security Requirements</h3>
<p>Envato takes security very seriously. The themes it lists must go offer security to its users. In order to ensure this, Envato has security guidelines for every uploaded theme which you should read at<a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000481243"> https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000481243. </a> These guidelines involve:</p>
<p>● <strong>Validation: </strong>Any data entered by a user must be double checked and validated. There are a number of ways to ensure that the entered data is as expected. You can read about this on Envato&rsquo;s Data Validation page at <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/data-validation/">https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/data-validation/ </a></p>
<p>● <strong>Sanitization: </strong>If data cannot be validated, then it must be sanitized. This is where your theme cleans or filters inputted data from a user, API, or web service. It&rsquo;s used when you cannot know what to expect exactly, so there&rsquo;s no way to test the validity of the input, such as in a text form. You can read more about this at <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/data-sanitization-escaping/">https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/data-sanitization-escaping/ </a></p>
<p>which is provided by WordPress and is what Envato also uses. </p>

<p>● <strong>Working With the Database: </strong>Your theme should not amend, create, update or delete any site content via the database. In some cases, working with the database is valid, and in such instances you should use the wpdb class. </p>

<p>● <strong>Escaping Output: </strong>Your theme should secure any data before it is rendered to the end user (site admin, customer etc.). The process for this is known as <em>escaping</em>. Envato recommends that users follow WordPress&rsquo;s guidelines on this issue at <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/securing-output/">https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/securing-output/</a></p>

<p>● <strong>User Capabilities: </strong>Your theme should only allow specific users with permissions to enter, send, and receive the data you want them to. To do this, your theme should check each user&rsquo;s capabilities using the <em>current_user_can()</em> function. To read more about these checks, visit<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/checking-user-capabilities/"> https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/checking-user-capabilities/</a></p>

<p>● <strong>Nonces: </strong>Nonces are used to verify the origin and intent of any request or submitted data. Each nonce is comprised of a unique generated number which can only be used once, increasing their security. Nonces are checked server side before the entered information is processed. If you want to know more about nonces and how to use them, check out this great article on the WordPress site -<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/nonces/">https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/nonces/ </a></p>

<p>● <strong>SVG Upload: </strong>SVG is a document format which carries information. Some Content Management Systems are happy using them to process and carry data, however, both WordPress and Envato advise against this as SVGs are notoriously unsecure. For this reason, Envato has banned themes from enabling SVG uploads. A great article about this can be found, here -<a href="https://bjornjohansen.no/svg-in-wordpress"> https://bjornjohansen.no/svg-in-wordpress</a></p>

<p>● <strong>Changelogs: </strong>Any update or release which contains security fixes must include a changelog which clearly outlines what those fixes are. </p>
<h3>General Requirements</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of overlap in this section, but this page by Envato provides a good overview of the general requirements your theme should meet before uploading<a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000481263">https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000481263 </a></p>
<h3>Gutenberg Requirements</h3>
<p>The Gutenberg editor for WordPress is an attempt to make the editing process more accessible for new WordPress users. If a theme is to include the Gutenberg editor, Envato requires that the theme:</p>
<p>● Must not blacklist blocks.</p>
<p>● Contains no console errors coming from Gutenberg itself.</p>
<p>● Must not register blocks itself as this must be done by a plugin because it involves content creation.</p>
<p>● Ensures that the WordPress core blocks match the design and style of any displayed theme demo.</p>
<p>These are all mandatory if you are going to include the Gutenberg editor. However, Envato has a number of further optional implementations it suggest, which can be found at<a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020255992-WordPress-Gutenberg-Requirements">https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020255992-WordPress-Gutenberg-</a><a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020255992-WordPress-Gutenberg-Requirements">Requirements</a></p>
<h2>Useful Tools </h2>
<p>The above covers most of what should be on your checklist as required by Envato. I thoroughly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the documentation. That being said, there is an option which can make this process easier. It&rsquo;s called <em>Envato Theme Check</em>. This is a plugin developed by Scott Parry, and is designed to be an easy way to ensure your theme passes Envato&rsquo;s review standards. It&rsquo;s a powerful tool for any developer, and I recommend it if the documentation surrounding all of this is a little overwhelming. You can find it at <a href="https://github.com/envato/envato-theme-check">https://github.com/envato/envato-theme-check </a></p>
<p>Another big help is the validator over at<a href="https://validator.w3.org/"> https://validator.w3.org/ </a>This is a great tool which carries out <em>markup validation</em>. It&rsquo;s essential a spell checker and grammar tool for HTML and other languages used to design websites. The Validator is free to use and should point you in the right direction during your checklist phase to ensure that your code is up to scratch, avoiding rejection from Envato.</p>
<p>Remember, even if your theme is rejected, though, you can resubmit. Sometimes it takes some trial and error, especially if you&rsquo;re new to all of this. So don&rsquo;t be too hard on yourself! At StylemixThemes, we always give our developers time and room to fail and then learn. It&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re where we are today. Embrace the learning curve!</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">Preparation of Graphics</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>


<p>There are a number of ways to market your theme successfully, but too many developers overlook the simplest forms of theme marketing. Just because something is simple, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not powerful! One of the best ways to attract customers to your theme is through the promotional images, screenshots, and icons which represent your theme on ThemeForest and the rest of Envato&rsquo;s market.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I&rsquo;m going to discuss how we at StylemixThemes has harnessed these graphics and how you should best prepare them when uploading your theme.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 14:</p>
<p>1. How to prepare graphics for marketing your theme.</p>
<p>2. Considerations for your ThemeForest preview</p>
<p>3. What to put on your item page.</p>
<p>4. What you should include in the fine print included with your products.</p>
<h2>It&rsquo;s Show Business </h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re marketing a theme, a new toy, or a movie - it&rsquo;s all show business. The business of <em>showing</em> your hard work to the world. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many developers fall down at this hurdle. Don&rsquo;t be one of them! There are so many great themes out there where developers have spent hundreds of hours of work on them only to sell very few because they didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the <em>show</em> part of the business.</p>
<p>To be a successful developer, it&rsquo;s not just about the theme, but how you <em>present</em> the theme to your potential audience. In the visual world we live in, seeing is believing, so the fastest way you can show your audience what your theme is capable of is through associated promotional images. Envato gives you the stage to present your theme graphics in an appealing way, so don&rsquo;t undo all your hard work by skipping this stage. Look at it as an integral part of selling your themes. Get excited about showing your work off to the world.</p>
<h2>The ThemeForest Preview </h2>
<p>While some authors don&rsquo;t care about it, we at StylemixThemes know just how important it is to showcase a theme. At the time of this writing, ThemeForest allows you a 590x300 resolution preview. If you use this preview correctly, it will bring in a higher click rate. The more people who click on your preview, the more potential customers you&rsquo;ll have, and, hopefully, the more buying customers you&rsquo;ll garner. Think of the ThemeForest Preview as a window into your store.</p>
<p>You have to grab the attention as customers pass by because there are many other stores out there. And so, this is about justifying your products. You have to justify why you should get a customer&rsquo;s time over any other developer.</p>
<h2>What to Include in Your Preview </h2>
<p>Remember our old friend, minimalism? Well, he&rsquo;s back again. The worst thing you can do is cram your 590x300 preview with too much information. Your preview should be clean and concise. You&rsquo;ll want a graphical element and a text element to your preview. Ensure that your text showcases the name of your theme plus a tagline. For example, at StylemixThemes our Pearl preview basically consists of the following text &ldquo;Pearl: 40+ Each demo is a masterpiece&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This tells our customers that our theme comes in 40 configurations of the box for a variety of purposes, and that we believe those configurations are of the highest standard. It would be dangerous for us to advertise in this way if we didn&rsquo;t genuinely believe the standard was so high. Hopefully, our potential customers take us at our word and think &ldquo;I want to see this theme in action&rdquo;. By including the number of configurations, we&rsquo;re also leaving our customers in no doubt that there will be something which will suit their needs. And we&rsquo;ve conveyed all of this with one line of text.</p>
<p>What you include in your text is up to you, but as a rule of thumb I&rsquo;ve found that no more than 2-3 features should be included. Any more than this and the preview becomes cluttered and more difficult to digest. Present your theme text and name in a clean, readable, and professional looking font (you can combine different sizes and fonts if it looks aesthetically pleasing).</p>
<p>Alongside your text, you&rsquo;ll need to include a visual representation of what your theme can do. I recommend a few small screenshots of your theme demo(s), showing some of the looks your customers can achieve, while using your text as a call to action or slogan.</p>
<p>You used to be able to include an 80x80 icon in your preview for a theme, but this has recently been removed from the ThemeForest preview at the time of this writing. Such an icon can still be used elsewhere, but it isn&rsquo;t as important now as it no longer appears in ThemeForest listings.</p>
<h2>Item Page </h2>
<p>If your preview is well worked out, hopefully you should be getting some clicks from potential customers. Those clicks will lead them to your item page. This page will outline what your theme is capable of in greater detail, and should be used to entice people to jump in and make a purchasing decision.</p>
<p>I cannot understate how important your item page is. If your preview is the store window, then the item page is your shop floor. Imagine how disappointed you would be as a customer if you saw a great store window which made you go inside a store, only to find the place dirty or unorganised. That wouldn&rsquo;t make you confident about buying something from there, would it?</p>
<p>Your theme customers are just the same. They need a great preview <em>and</em> a fantastic item page to seal the deal.</p>
<h2>What to Put on Your Item Page </h2>
<p>There are various ways to set up your item page. It&rsquo;s also important to keep your item pages relevant by looking at what other successful developers are doing with their item pages.</p>
<p>Customers will develop expectations about what they think they should see on an item page, so you want to either meet those expectations or exceed them with your presentation.</p>
<p>I would recommend creating a promo video as your first image. That way you can convey more about your theme to a customer in a stylistic, concise way without relying on too much text. A secondary image which lists the outstanding features of your item is also useful to back this up.</p>
<p>I would also recommend that you include information up front about what industry/niche your theme is for, no messing about! Finally, you can showcase some previews for how many demos your theme has and some other features.</p>
<p>Keep SEO in mind when designing your item page. Google will index the text you use which isn&rsquo;t image based. This is a great opportunity to research some search terms and include the keywords and/or phrases you think customers will be using to find a theme such as yours.</p>
<p>When you upload your theme, you&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to include up to 15 tags which will also boost your SEO and your visibility on Envato. Please think deeply about this. Don&rsquo;t just throw up any old tag. These tags are so important in helping people find your hard work. Add tags based on your chosen niche and try to think of some which are commonly used by customers, but not by competitors. Generic tags will just bury your theme in a sea of noise.</p>
<h2>The Fine Print </h2>
<p>One last thing I would like to touch on is text to help avoid bad reviews. When there is confusion between the customer and the developer, especially when it comes to expectations about how a theme should perform, it results in a bad relationship. To protect yourself, there are some things you should include on your item page:</p>
<p><strong>1. Changelog</strong>: By including a link to your changelod on the item page or banner, potential customers can quickly see how often you update the changelog and what sort of fixes have been performed lately. It also lets you customers know if the theme operates differently to how some reviewers have described it. </p>
<p><strong>2. Refunds</strong>: Customers will have their own ideas about when and how they should receive a refund. However you choose to offer refunds, or not offer them, some text which covers this on the item page will help keep everyone on the same page. An example of this would be something along the lines of - &ldquo;<em>Important: Please be sure you check out</em> <em>the demo and ask all the questions you need answered regarding the theme features </em></p>
<p> <em>before purchase (you can use the comment board or Forum:</em> <em>https://stylemixthemes.com/forums/ &ndash; for all presale questions). Purchases completed by</em> <em>mistake or for features that don&rsquo;t exist cannot be refunded. </em>&rdquo; </p>
<p><strong>3. Your Brand</strong>: While the main goal of your item page is to sell a specific theme, there&rsquo;s also an opportunity to sell other themes or expand awareness of your brand. At the end of your item page you can include links or banners to other themes you have designed.</p>
<p>This is especially useful if a customer likes your work on the theme in question but is looking for something a little different. If you have other themes on offer, then they might find what they are looking for there, and you won&rsquo;t miss out on a sale! </p>

<p>It would be great if all a developer had to do was make a fantastic theme and then watch it climb to the top of ThemeForest&rsquo;s rankings. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not that simple. With so many great developers out there, it&rsquo;s difficult to stand out from the crowd. That&rsquo;s where marketing and promotion come in. At StylemixThemes, we&rsquo;ve learned a lot through the years, figuring out how best to sell our themes and make ourselves known to the world. Marketing is a difficult task, but if you follow our model, and bring your own individuality to your marketing strategies as well, then your themes should sell well.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 15:</p>
<p>1. The difference between outside and inside promotion.</p>
<p>2. How to find an effective marketing strategy for any theme.</p>
<p>3. How to combine your marketing strategies to create synergy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how StylemixThemes approaches marketing, and how you can implement our approach to increase your sales numbers.</p>
<h2>Finding a Strategy That Works </h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find that you'll need to do a lot of experimenting to find out what works specifically for your themes. You&rsquo;ll also discover that you have to alter your approach over the years as your business grows and customer expectations change.</p>
<p>To come up with the best solutions, I&rsquo;ve narrowed my process down to:</p>
<p>● <strong>Brainstorming with my Staff</strong>: I always value the insight of those I work with. When we get down to it and brainstorm marketing ideas, there is always someone with a unique take on it in our group. Brainstorming sessions are great for this. Get some ideas flowing and try them out.</p>
<p>● <strong>A/B Testing</strong>: This simply means we test more than one marketing technique at a time and compare them. A small version of each approach is implemented, then we see which performs best before scaling up. This can be comparing two very different techniques or the same technique but targeting different demographics such as age groups or audience types. In the long run, this will save you from investing too much money in things which don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>● <strong>The Competition</strong>: We talked about trends in an earlier chapter when choosing a niche.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly the same for marketing. I&rsquo;ve found that with a little research looking into our competitors and their approaches to marketing, that we can learn from this and tweak</p>
<p>their approaches to come up with something even better. Marketing approaches change over time, so stay relevant. If you don&rsquo;t, your promotional material could look dated, which will hurt your brand. </p>
<h2>Outside Vs Inside </h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on many different themes by myself and with my team, and it&rsquo;s become clear to me that there are largely two marketing approaches you should consider:</p>
<p>● <strong>Outside</strong>: This involves any way to promote your themes and your brand outside of Envato.</p>
<p>● <strong>Inside</strong>: How to make best use of the marketing tools Envato provides you as a ThemeForest developer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve created a quick list for you that we use, this clearly highlights which approaches are available to you in both categories. While looking at these techniques, I want you think about</p>
<p><em><strong>funneling</strong></em><strong>. </strong>This is a marketing term which simply means guiding your potential customers to your products, much like pouring water down a funnel into a container. Both <strong>Outside</strong> and <strong>Inside</strong> marketing categories are built on this concept. Don&rsquo;t waste time on anything which doesn&rsquo;t funnel people to your themes and brand!</p>
<h2>Outside Promotion </h2>
<p>As with most marketing, promoting your themes is a real process of trial and error. There are many other avenues for promotion outside of ThemeForest, but if you spend too much time on too many different avenues, you won&rsquo;t get much done. Instead, it&rsquo;s more economical with your time and money to focus on a limited number of promotions. I&rsquo;ve created the following list which focuses on the avenues which have proved most successful for me in funneling potential customers to StylemixThemes and its products:</p>
<p>● <strong>Pinterest</strong>: A social media platform where users share images about their interests.</p>
<p>● <strong>Twitter</strong>: A great place to post regular updates and releases about your business.</p>
<p>● <strong>Youtube</strong>: Video content is an excellent way to convey information quickly to your customers. </p>
<p>● <strong>Review Websites</strong>: WordPress and Plugin review websites which have a ready made audience looking for well designed themes for their projects.</p>
<p>● <strong>Newsletters</strong>: Both our own email mailing list and featuring on other email lists for third party cross promotion, works well.</p>
<p>● <strong>Other Third Party Sites</strong>: Where we buy banner ads as well as featuring sponsored posts when relevant.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the obvious omission here - Facebook. I think Facebook <em>can</em> work as a great way to promote when you have a large community there. It really can work for you as a developer.</p>
<p>Facebook ads, however, are a different story. We&rsquo;ve spent thousands of dollars experimenting with Facebook ads and have gained very little from this. The same can be said of Instagram. I&rsquo;m not saying adverts <em>won&rsquo;t</em> work there, but in my experience you can throw a lot of money at it which would be best spent elsewhere when promoting your themes.</p>
<p>Pinterest has been altogether a different experience for me and StylemixThemes. When you submit a paid advertisement, Pinterest assigns you a staff member to help get the best out of your ad. This includes how the ad is designed and how best to target it in terms of your chosen demographic.</p>
<p>Email is a phenomenal way to market your themes. So much so that we&rsquo;ll discuss this in its own chapter, so we'll move on from it for now.</p>
<p>If you can pay a reviewer, then review websites are a great way to increase your sales. This also applies to paid newsletter promotions. It&rsquo;s best to focus on websites which are connected to WordPress themes and plugins. For example, Speckyboy.com and Colorlib.com are great for this sort of thing. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to send out query emails to them and similar sites. People will be more than willing to review your theme, and some will do so for a very reasonable rate. The flip side of this is that you could get a bad review, but that&rsquo;s the risk we all run as creative people. Put your best foot forward and only submit items for review that you feel showcase what you can really do.</p>
<p>Likewise, banner ads are a great option. I recommend, again, focusing on WordPress review sites. However, you can also branch out to tech websites or sites specifically attached to your chosen niche. Making a theme for medical professionals? Then get some banner ads on a website which is used by medical professionals. There are lots of places to advertise in this way, so have some brainstorming sessions to figure out your plan of action. Just make sure that anywhere you buy ads actually has an audience. Ask for visitor numbers when querying a webmaster.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had particular success using Youtube. It&rsquo;s a great promotional space for WordPress themes and plugins. Best of all, it&rsquo;s free and gives you access to millions of potential customers.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, this is the approach we are working on the most. In our initial experiences, the interaction with people is what sets it apart. We can answer questions on relevant videos while showcasing what a theme can do visually. If video production isn&rsquo;t your strong suit, you can always hire a freelance editor to help create short, captivating videos about your themes. Creating tutorials and other useful videos is also a great way to bring people to your channel. Promoting your channel can be challenging because of the number of videos out there. I&rsquo;d recommend funneling existing and potential customers to your Youtube channel to boost its viewing figures which will in turn increase your search ranking through Youtube&rsquo;s algorithm (more on this later in the chapter).</p>
<h2>Inside Promotion </h2>
<p>Promotion inside of ThemeForest is limited, but this makes sense. If Envato allowed everyone to constantly promote their themes and brand, customers would be overwhelmed with information and would be turned off from using Envato&rsquo;s marketplace.</p>
<p>There are two options for inside promotion:</p>
<p><strong>1. Promotional Campaigns</strong>: Competitions and curated campaigns listed by Envato employees. </p>
<p><strong>2. Freebies</strong>: Free versions of themes to boost your brand and create goodwill between you and your customer base. </p>
<p>Envato holds regular promotional campaigns each year. There&rsquo;s no set number in terms of when these campaigns run. Sometimes they are monthly and at other times quarterly or even annual like their Easter Deals campaign. Envato has a number of services, so only some of these promotional campaigns will be open to ThemeForest items. They are usually announced via the Envato forums at<a href="https://forums.envato.com/"> https://forums.envato.com/. </a> The stipulations for entering will be listed in any announcement post, but usually your theme must have at least a 4 star rating to be included. Some promotions only allow you to submit one theme for consideration while others will allow multiple submissions. If your theme is selected, then it will be listed on the ThemeForest landing page and featured as a special deal, which will usually involve some sort of discount for the customer.</p>
<p>If you are selected for inclusion, you&rsquo;ll get a great boost in terms of visibility. These aren&rsquo;t the only types of promotions Envato runs, however. You can also enter regular developer competitions which, if you win a slot, will afford you things like free merchandise and other goodies to boost your brand. Needless to say, a lot of developers enter such competitions, but as the old saying goes - you can&rsquo;t win the lottery if you don&rsquo;t buy a ticket. It&rsquo;s well worth keeping an eye out for these opportunities.</p>
<p>A second way to inside promote is to give away some freebies. I mentioned in an earlier chapter that in some cases we make themes freely available. This is usually because the theme isn&rsquo;t selling particularly well or we feel it would work as a promotional item. Another approach is to create a version of a paid theme which has limited features. This will persuade users to buy the full version if they have a good experience with the paid version. There is a downside to all of this, however. You cannot normally list your themes through ThemeForest as free. You have to be selected for Envato&rsquo;s &ldquo;free file of the month&rdquo; promotion. For this reason, your free theme version will most probably end up being an &ldquo;outside&rdquo; promotion through your own website. But still very worth it!</p>
<h2>Combining Outside and Inside Marketing </h2>
<p>Lastly, I want to share my experiences of combining these two approaches. Put simply, this is the secret to a strong marketing strategy. I&rsquo;ve learned that none of my marketing materials and promotional campaigns should sit in isolation. After all, when you set up your own promotional campaigns, you&rsquo;ll be doing so to reach the same goal - sell themes! If all of these approaches are for the same goal, then it makes sense to design them in such a way that they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>For example, I mentioned Youtube earlier. Promoting on Youtube is difficult because it&rsquo;s such a vast website. The Youtube algorithm boosts the visibility of videos when people start watching.</p>
<p>So, how do you get that initial bump in viewers to get the ball rolling? Well, imagine you&rsquo;ve created a video about installing WordPress themes. Your hope is that people will watch, subscribe to your channel, and then you&rsquo;ll be able to market your products directly to those subscribers. A great way to start this is to <em>funnel</em> your customers to your channel. This could be a banner ad, an email to your mailing list subscribers, or a post on your social media account of choice. In turn, your Youtube channel could contain links to your ThemeForest page, your website, and to your mailing list or social media both on your Youtube channel page and in the description of your videos. You can even run competitions on your channel if people are subscribed and comment. Bring it all together in a way that will boost all of your marketing strategies and create a community vibe. People like to be part of something, help them be part of your theme brand.</p>
<p>On our ThemeForest profile at<a href="https://themeforest.net/user/stylemixthemes"> https://themeforest.net/user/stylemixthemes, </a> we have links to our Twitter and Facebook pages. In our profile description, you&rsquo;ll also see our website -<a href="http://www.stylemixthemes.com/">www.stylemixthemes.com. </a> This isn&rsquo;t by accident. These small touches mean that some customers will visit those places. They might download a freebie from our website or follow us on Twitter. Then they might see posts for our Youtube channel, bringing in more viewers and increasing our visibility on the platform.</p>
<p>Linking everything together is a brilliant way to maximize your success as a developer. It&rsquo;s helped StylemixThemes become a Power Elite Author on ThemeForest, and it can do the same for you!</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">The Key to Success - Email Marketing</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>


<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that a lot of developers focus on marketing their themes through social media.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt this is an important step, but many do this while ignoring the most powerful marketing tool of all: Email marketing. In this chapter, I&rsquo;m going to take you through how at StylemixThemes we have used email marketing to climb the ThemeForest rankings and become a Top Elite ThemeForest developer. By following our approach, hopefully you will be able to achieve the same results.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 16:</p>
<p>1. The three ways email marketing is important.</p>
<p>2. How to get your email marketing right first time.</p>
<p>3. How to build an email list.</p>
<p>4. What makes a good marketing email campaign.</p>
<h2>Three Ways Email is Important </h2>
<p>The main reason email is glossed over by so many developers is that it feels old hat. It&rsquo;s a technology which has been around for decades, and social media has largely surpassed it as a way to communicate concisely and speedily between family, friends, and customers. If you dig a little deeper, however, you&rsquo;ll come to realise that email is still incredibly useful in selling any product out there - especially WordPress themes.</p>
<p>At StylemixThemes, we&rsquo;ve identified three main ways email is important:</p>
<p><strong>1. Communication</strong>: On each developer&rsquo;s ThemeForest profile there is an option to send a message to the developer via email. This is done through a small form on the page, and while many customers use other means to connect with us, we still receive messages in this way. It would be counterproductive to ignore such messages, so we answer them whenever we receive them. </p>
<p><strong>2. Funneling</strong>: Email marketing is a powerful way to funnel existing and potential customers to new products. Once someone has agreed to be contacted by your company, you can then send emails specifically marketed to them, encouraging them to visit a specific theme on your ThemeForest profile. This is the type of email usage we&rsquo;ll be focussing on in this chapter. </p>
<p><strong>3. Personal Touch</strong>: An email can add a personal touch to a communication. If a customer has queries about your themes, and you converse with them over email directly, this creates a personal connection. It&rsquo;s not always about mass-marketed emails: Showing</p>
<p>that you care about your customers by conversing with them in this way, creates another positive imprint of your brand. </p>
<h2>Getting it Right, First Time </h2>
<p>You already know the drill - much of what&rsquo;s in this book is about learning through experience.</p>
<p>When I started out, I have to admit that I underutilized email as a way to communicate with existing and potential customers. When StylemixThemes started selling WordPress themes, I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to email marketing, finding such emails to be a distraction more than anything else. I was passionate about creating, but not so committed to endless communication and promotion.</p>
<p>I learned that there is a balance to be found when using email to communicate with people.</p>
<p>Whether it is ensuring that you aren&rsquo;t bombarding people&rsquo;s inboxes with constant promotional emails, or avoiding putting so much time into email correspondence and marketing that you never get anything else done - moderation is the key here.</p>
<p>After developing WordPress themes for a while, I realised that I needed to be more invested in email as a way to sell our themes. I looked at our competitors and saw them utilizing newsletters/mailing lists in order to boost their sales. This was something I needed to oversee as well to give my business every chance of success. It wasn&rsquo;t just fellow theme developers who were doing this, I saw bloggers of all descriptions having great success with email campaigns.</p>
<p>The takeaway is, don&rsquo;t make my mistake. Incorporate email marketing and communication into your company as soon as possible. But...</p>
<p><strong>You need a mailing list</strong>.</p>
<p>A mailing list is simply a list of customer email addresses which you can use to advertise your products, but how do you get those emails in the first place?</p>
<h2>How to Build Your Email List </h2>
<p>When I saw the power of newsletter campaigns and mailing lists, I knew I had to figure out a way to build such a list for StylemixThemes. It goes without saying (but I&rsquo;m going to say it anyway as you <em>need</em> to know this point) you shouldn&rsquo;t gather customer emails without their permission. That is an ethical and PR disaster for your company!</p>
<p>The solution I used was to build our mailing list through ThemeForest itself. First, I set up an account over at Mailchimp. This is a fantastic service that allows you to build email lists easily.</p>
<p>Its basic package is free, but you can scale with them as your business and mailing list grows. I can&rsquo;t recommend it highly enough.</p>
<p>Once I had set up a Mailchimp account, I gathered customer emails in three ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Ticket System</strong>: On ThemeForest, we encourage customers with queries and support issues to head over to our website at stylemixthemes.com. There, they use our ticket system which ensures that we can answer their queries quickly. To use the ticket system, customers have to provide their email as a sign up. We include a disclaimer during the sign up asking if we can contact the customer about promotional offers and other theme-related topics. This helped us to build a mailing list, quickly. </p>
<p><strong>2. Freebies</strong>: I&rsquo;ve mentioned the importance of offering free themes and other products to create goodwill with customers. This is another great way to build a mailing list. By offering free themes on our website, all we asked for in return was a customer signup to our site, including their email address and the right to send them promotional materials. </p>
<p><strong>3. Live Chat</strong>: A live chat window on your website works well to communicate with customers and answer queries directly. It&rsquo;s also effective in that you can encourage customers to leave their email addresses when using this service, adding more addresses to your list. </p>
<p>Each time you gather a new email address, you can add it to your mailing list. You do this through Mailchimp&rsquo;s simple yet powerful interface. You can also simply create a mailing list through Gmail or another email provider; however, I would strongly recommend using Mailchimp. You can also create a landing page for your mailing list through Mailchimp. This will give you a link which you can then send out through social media and other means to customers. When they click on the link, they will be sent to your mailing list landing page, which will have a little information about what your list is all about and a simple form window to sign up. We&rsquo;ve also included a &ldquo;subscribe to our newsletter&rdquo; widget on several of our pages on our site, and that has worked well for us.</p>
<h2>What Makes Good Marketing Email? </h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what you <em>must</em> include via Mailchimp and other services when creating a mailing list:</p>
<p>● <strong>Physical Address</strong>: Any mailing list must be connected to a physical location or address.</p>
<p>Depending on your region, this may be required by law. This is to stop people from creating endless lists for illegal means. Your physical location could be your home address, though I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend that as you don&rsquo;t want someone turning up at your home! If you have an office or business premises, then you can use that. If not, I recommend something similar to a PO Box. You can rent or buy these from various postal services. It&rsquo;s essentially just the address of a post office which keeps any physical</p>
<p>mail you receive for you. Mailchimp will ask you for this address on setup, and will provide that information to any of your mailing list members who request it.</p>
<p>● <strong>A Subject</strong>: Most users will only see the subject heading of your email. That&rsquo;s what will entice them to open your marketing email. Make sure it is specific, enticing, and <em>not</em> misleading. This could be about a new theme you have released, a discount you are offering, or even helpful information to assist your customers in getting the most from their WordPress installations. </p>
<p>● <strong>Call to Action</strong>: Usually abbreviated to CTA, a call to action is the moment where you encourage your mailing list members to take action. This usually involves clicking a link which then will take them to your theme on ThemeForest or your website. Your call to action should be simple, powerful, persuasive, and organic without feeling forced. Your email can contain more than one CTA if you are covering more than one offer. </p>
<p>● <strong>Unsubscribe Button</strong>: Each email should contain a link in small text at the bottom of your content, allowing each mailing list member to unsubscribe. Most regions require this by law, and if you don&rsquo;t include it your customers will become frustrated with receiving emails they don&rsquo;t want. This will only hurt your reputation. Give people the option to unsubscribe, but make your emails useful and unobtrusive so very few want to! </p>
<h2>Posting Schedule </h2>
<p>People <em>hate</em> spam emails. Some developers get trigger happy and send way too many over a short space of time. Everyone has their own suggestions about how best to avoid annoying customers with too many emails, while still getting the information you need into customers&rsquo;</p>
<p>hands. After a good amount of experimentation, at StylemixThemes, we&rsquo;ve settled on about two emails per week.</p>
<h2>Your Email Content </h2>
<p>Deciding on what to include in your emails takes time. I recommend a short, concise welcome email to a mailing list first. You can automate this through Mailchimp. This is just a way to acknowledge that a signup worked and to briefly mention your themes and how happy you are that the receiver is interested in what your company has to offer. After this, the real work begins.</p>
<p>If you can afford to hire a marketer with experience in running successful email campaigns, then that&rsquo;s fantastic. If not, then you&rsquo;ll need to brainstorm some ideas by yourself or with your team.</p>
<p>At StylemixThemes, we tend to split our two emails per week into two categories:</p>
<p><strong>1. Big Event</strong>: This email is usually about a new theme release or a big theme update. </p>
<p><strong>2. Small Event</strong>: This email is sent later in the week and includes information about a new blog post or any other non-critical issue. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve found this to be a great way to structure our email marketing. Another great approach which we&rsquo;ve used many times, is to work on campaigns. These campaigns are a series of emails which follow a similar theme. This could be a series of emails filled with tips around one aspect of website design. You can send these emails over several weeks or you can have one master email with a link to that specific campaign so users can access the information all at once at their leisure. </p>
<h2>What is Success? </h2>
<p>The great thing about using Mailchimp is that you can see just how successful your email campaigns are. The Mailchimp dashboard will tell you how many people opened your email to read it (the open rate) and how many people clicked on your call to action (click through rate).</p>
<p>On average, somewhere between a 10% and 21% open rate is healthy, while a click through rate of about 3% is also seen as successful. Now, you might be saying &ldquo;3%! Hardly seems worth it!&rdquo;, but let&rsquo;s put that into perspective. If you have 1,000 people on your mailing list, that&rsquo;s 30 people. Now even if just half of those people buy a product, that&rsquo;s 15 people for one email. If your theme is selling for $60, that&rsquo;s $900! All from a single email. Build that up over a few years and your email mailing list could generate thousands of dollars worth of new revenue.</p>
<p>Use your stats to see which emails are being opened the most and which CTAs are being clicked on regularly. Eliminate what doesn&rsquo;t work and focus on the emails which do.</p>

</div>


<p>There are several ways to build your business as a developer, and one of the most powerful is to use referrals. In my time building StylemixThemes from a small outfit to one of ThemeForest&rsquo;s biggest sellers, referrals have proven to be extremely helpful in creating, not just a quality brand reputation, but sustainable and growing sales.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 17:</p>
<p>1. My experience using referrals.</p>
<p>2. The power of referrals as a marketing tool.</p>
<p>3. How to use referrals to build your reputation.</p>
<p>4. Tips on how to generate referrals.</p>
<h2>What is a Referral? </h2>
<p>In earlier chapters, we established that word of mouth is a fantastic way to bring in new customers and create positive momentum for your developer business. Referrals have a lot in common with that process. With word of mouth, customers review their experiences of your themes and support offerings. They will also recommend your themes and your brand to other people when they are looking to build a website. Referrals involve taking word of mouth one stage further.</p>
<p>A good referral strategy is to get existing businesses and customers to share links and content which will lead others to your products. This is usually a symbiotic relationship, as both you and the referer gain something when someone clicks the link.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take an example. The Amazon Affiliate program is used by many people to generate extra revenue. A Youtuber can talk about a product and then leave a link in their video description. If people like the product because of the video and then click on the link, it takes them directly to the product in question. If a customer then buys the product, the Youtuber would receive a percentage of the sale for referring the customer to the product.</p>
<p>As a developer, there are a bunch of great options for such referrals, so let&rsquo;s take a look at a few.</p>
<h2>Effective Referral Strategies </h2>
<p>I have to admit that for a long time I did not value referrals the way I should have. I knew that, for example, Envato had their own affiliate program like Amazon, but collectively as a company we didn&rsquo;t see it as a particularly effective outlet for us. That all changed a few years ago when we were brainstorming ideas to create new revenue streams for StylemixThemes.</p>
<p>Although our initial reaction to the Envato affiliate program was lukewarm, the more we discussed it and explored how it worked, the more our excitement grew. When you run your own theme development business, you really should not overlook anything which can bring in new revenue. Such streams can help significantly expand your business, and they can also get you through times when your sales are not as high as you had hoped. Of course, your time and other resources are finite, so what makes or breaks your investment in a new revenue stream is knowing how much time and money you will require to make it work.</p>
<p>When it comes to using effective referrals, the investment of time and money is minimal, while the rewards can be significant. For this reason alone, it is worth pursuing.</p>
<h2>Envato Affiliate Program </h2>
<p>One of the first referral programs we turned to was Envato&rsquo;s affiliate program. What makes this a great option is that it is built into the ThemeForest eco system, and so is very easy to set up and use. When we first approached the Envato affiliate program, what made us want to try it out was the fact that we already regularly spent a great deal on advertising each month. This was our eureka moment. As we already paid for ad space on various websites, why not include an Envato referral link with those ads?</p>
<h2>How Envato Referrals Work</h2>
<p>When you sign up for the Envato affiliate program, you will be given a referral link for your theme(s). What&rsquo;s really beautiful about this as opposed to some other referral programs, is that you don&rsquo;t need a potential customer to buy that specific theme in order to make money! All you have to be able to do is encourage people to click the link through social media, ads, mailing lists, CTAs etc. When someone does click on the link, it will bring them to ThemeForest. If from that point on a person signs up, browses ThemeForest, and even buys a theme which is not your own, Envato will give you 30% commission! Think of that, 30% commission on a product you never even made. It should be noted that you only receive commission on their very first purchase.</p>
<p>Envato currently uses Impact Radius to keep track of these sales, which is a well known and reliable system for doing so. This provides peace of mind that when someone clicks your link and then buys something on ThemeForest, the sale will be registered correctly. Impact Radius also ensures that you have an accurate measure of which referral links are being clicked. You can then see which ads are more effective in generating new revenue for you.</p>
<p>Just by doing this alone, StylemixThemes quickly generated an additional revenue of up to $1,000 per month, which can be scaled up as you grow your affiliate marketing strategy. Ask yourself, for a minimum amount of time investment, can you really overlook $1,000 worth of revenue a month?</p>
<h2>Third-Party Referrals </h2>
<p>I highly recommend starting with Envato&rsquo;s affiliate program. However, third party affiliate programs can also be used to great effect when generating referrals. Of course, it&rsquo;s best if these are related to theme development or WordPress so that you can funnel people to these products naturally. It can be a little jarring for customers if you are offering referrals to a completely unconnected product like clothing. Not only that, but you are also less likely to generate significant clicks because your customers are interested in themes, so anything else will likely get ignored.</p>
<p>We use referral programs through SportsPress and WPML plugins. SportsPress is a plugin which allows you to create leagues, fixtures, and standings for websites involved in real-life, fantasy, and gaming sports. WPML Plugins offer a range of plugins based around multilingual use. By signing up for both these referral programs, when we provide our customers with these links to those plugins, if they purchase one, we receive a commission.</p>
<p>There are many different referral options out there, so I would recommend looking around and then picking what&rsquo;s relative to theme development and/or your chosen theme niche. Don&rsquo;t be shy in contacting third party companies, either. If you can help boost their sales, they&rsquo;ll be happy to give you a percentage.</p>
<h2>Tips for Generating Referrals </h2>
<p>Once you have a referral agreement in place, you should now brainstorm some ideas with regards to generating clicks. How are you going to entice people to click on your referral link?</p>
<p>This will be specific to your niche and branding, but here are some general points which I find work well:</p>
<p>● <strong>Competitions</strong>: You can run some competitions or announce some giveaways to your existing customers. This encourages customers to recommend you to others, which will in turn create a wider audience for your referral strategy. </p>
<p>● <strong>Social Media</strong>: You can promote referrals through your social media accounts. Make sure you include that it is an advertisement. </p>
<p>● <strong>Mailing List</strong>: Similar to your social media campaigns, your mailing list is a great way to include referral links with a snappy piece of copy to entice clicks. </p>
<p>● <strong>Discounts</strong>: Stay in touch with those running any referral program. If they are offering a discount on products, include your referral link and promote it to your existing customer base. </p>
<p>● <strong>Don&rsquo;t Overdo It</strong>: Your customers don&rsquo;t want to be bludgeoned over the head with offers, discounts, and referral continually. Ensure that your referral promotions are not overwhelming and constant. This will generate a bad reputation.</p>
<p>● <strong>Network</strong>: Continue to speak with other developers and businesses who offer payment for referrals. Even in instances where you can&rsquo;t generate money directly, you might be able to exchange promotional links to boost your sales in the long run. </p>
<p>Creating a successful referral program is a fantastic way to generate a healthy side revenue for your developer business. Keep at it, and eventually you will have a substantial amount coming in from referrals, boosting your income and increasing your visibility as a brand.</p>

<h1 class="chaptertitle">Theme Analytics & Data Mining</h1>
<h3 class="author">Igor Ligay</h3>
</div>

<p>Measuring performance isn&rsquo;t easy. How do you know which themes you should invest more time in? How can you tell if one of your themes is performing the way that it should? What sort of information can you use to maximize your chances of growing your sales in the future?</p>
<p>These are all important questions, and ones which took me a while to answer. It&rsquo;s easy to be put off when you hear buzzwords like &ldquo;analytics&rdquo; and &ldquo;data mining&rdquo;, but these two terms have become a linchpin for what we do at StylemixThemes. They help us answer these difficult questions about performance and forecasting for the future. In essence, they show you what you are doing right and what you need to focus more of your time on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s then take a look at analytics and data mining, and I&rsquo;ll show you how understanding both transformed StylemixThemes and will transform your performance as a developer in the future.</p>
<p>What You Will Learn in Chapter 18:</p>
<p>1. What are analytics and data mining?</p>
<p>2. How Envato uses analytics.</p>
<p>3. How to use Google Analytics to generate data.</p>
<p>4. How your data should inform design choices.</p>
<h2>What are Analytics and Data Mining? </h2>
<p>The term analytics simply means to analyze information or &ldquo;data&rdquo;. Data mining is in itself a form of analysis. We &ldquo;mine&rdquo; data like a dwarf with a pickaxe, searching through the information we have gathered for new and revealing hints about where our themes are performing best, and worst.</p>
<p>Analytics have become an essential part of the internet, especially in social media and networking circles. In the past, collecting such data was laborious, and often you had to hire statistics experts to gather all the data and put it together in a palatable way. Thankfully, analytics statistics are available automatically on a number of platforms. ThemeForest generates this information for you, but we can also turn to Google Analytics to help supplement this data with helpful information.</p>
<h2>Envato Analytics and How to Use Them </h2>
<p>Envato/ThemeForest has its own analytics. This feature allows you to see relevant statistics attached to each theme. I&rsquo;ve found this incredibly important in measuring the success of each theme we have developed at StylemixThemes. Remember, this is simply information we can use to chart a more efficient course moving forward. Don&rsquo;t be put off by the term &ldquo;statistics&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Think of analytics as a compass pointing you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Envato&rsquo;s services automatically generate sales information for you whether you are using ThemeForest or even another service such as Codecanyon. When you log into your account, you will see that you have an <em>analytics</em> tab for each item you sell. When you click on this tab, you&rsquo;ll see the information which Envato has compiled for you. This includes:</p>
<p>● Visitor numbers to your theme.</p>
<p>● Referral sources tracking where your traffic has come from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s especially useful to see where your sales are coming from through referrals. Having this information allows you to assess the performance of the referrals you are using. This is an excellent way to gauge where you should invest more of your marketing budget. If you are receiving many more referrals from one website as opposed to another, then it will be worth your time to either prioritize the site doing well for you or, alternatively, you could change your referral strategy for the site which is not funneling people to your theme(s) effectively.</p>
<p>In some instances, you may not be intimately familiar with where your ads are appearing. The referral analytics which Envato provides allow you to clearly see where you are seeing the largest gains in sales. You can click on any of these links and visit each website. We often compare the performance of our referrals/ads with the general performance of each source. For example, you can use websites like Alexa or Similarweb to find out what the general traffic is for those websites. You will then have a better understanding of how your ads or referrals are really performing. If you have an ad appearing on a website which has a high number of visitors, say more than 100k a month, and your referral link is performing poorly, then it&rsquo;s worth trying to figure out why. If, on the other hand, a referral site&rsquo;s general traffic has lessened significantly, it might be worth putting your ads/referral links on another site.</p>
<p>At StylemixThemes, we often use this tactic to focus on the website referrals coming from popular sites, increasing our advertising on said websites. However, you might not have the budget to do this in the beginning. If your advertising budget is limited, box clever and choose smaller sites within your niche where you can still generate a decent number of sales. You can then use the analytics tab on ThemeForest to judge the general performance of those ads and then adjust your strategy accordingly.</p>
<p>While your referrals can come from banner ads, remember that you should also be seeing a good number of referrals from other sources such as paid blog posts, reviews, giveaways, and your newsletter campaigns. Again, these referral statistics will help you see which of these are working for you and which are not. When it comes to things like mailing lists, we&rsquo;ve found that they are so important that if they are not leading to referrals, then it is how promotional emails are being written/targeted that is the issue - not the email list itself. Unlike ads which can be removed from sites which are not performing, I highly recommend that you always persevere</p>
<p>with mailing lists and giveaways etc, as they will generate sales eventually. You just have to find the correct marketing approach for you niche. Analytics will help show you the way.</p>
<h2>Envato Marketing API </h2>
<p>On top of using the basic Envato analytics tab, we also incorporate the Envato Marketing API into our data gathering. Envato has<a href="https://build.envato.com/api/"> an excellent page on their API </a>outlining how to use it, however, the basic gist is that an API is an application interface which you can use to create an app. This app can be pointed towards ThemeForest sales and will gather data for you. The API can be programmed to provide you with detailed statistics about your own sales, but also the sales of your competitors. By using the API in this way, we can quickly see how a specific niche or competitor is performing. By tracking both our own sales and the sales of our competitors, this provides us with a goal; a benchmark which we can measure our own performance against, and something we can aim for when giving ourselves performance/sales targets for each theme.</p>
<p>Any author can use the Envato API and access this information. With it you can generate a number of useful analytics such as the growth rates of your own sales and how one of your themes compares to the performance of your competitors in a similar niche.</p>
<h2>Using Google Analytics </h2>
<p>One of the things we love about Envato is that it allows us to incorporate Google Analytics directly onto our theme pages. Google Analytics is an essential data gathering option regardless of whether you are selling themes, cars, or even just gauging visitor numbers to your personal blog. Through it, you can generate a Google Analytics ID. When you include this ID on any page, Google automatically tracks important information about visitors and sales.</p>
<p>To do this you&rsquo;ll first need to generate your Google Analytics ID if you don&rsquo;t already have one.</p>
<p>This involves a simple signup at analytics.google.com. It&rsquo;s a really simple process, and the website takes you through the steps to generate a piece of code which you can then include anywhere on a webpage to gain insights about visitors.</p>
<p>You could fill a full book with why Google Analytics is useful to developers, but it will essentially generate custom reports, revealing useful insights about your visitors. You can generate reports to see who buys from you the most, the number of sales, the number of times a visitor returns to your products, most sold items, and a raft of other details.</p>
<p>One of the best things about using analytics is that you can see which global regions are most productive for you. For example, let&rsquo;s say you are performing particularly well in Europe, you could then use this information to target that region through new ad campaigns, guest posts, and reviews in that area. Furthermore, you can use Google Adwords to figure out which</p>
<p>keywords you should include in your content to attract more people from your most important sales market. </p>
<h2>Who Should Analyze Your Data? </h2>
<p>When you have gathered or generated your data, the next important step is to decide who should analyze it. You can generate the best data in the world, but if the wrong person analyzes it, you will miss out on important insights. Who you decide to draw conclusions from your data is up to you, and it will also depend on your circumstances. Options open to you include:</p>
<p>● Doing it yourself.</p>
<p>● Asking an existing team member to do it.</p>
<p>● Hiring someone specifically to carry out analytics gathering and analysis.</p>
<p>● Using a freelancer to analyze your data when needed.</p>
<p>Whichever option you go for is going to depend on your available budget. If you are currently working on your own or as part of a small team, then you may not have the sales yet to hire an analyst full time. In this situation, you can find who is most suitable in your team and allocate some time to them for analytics. Freelancing is also a great way to go, bringing someone in every quarter, for example, to do a complete analysis for you.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I did all of our analysis myself. I learned a lot, and it was a great experience learning the ropes and implementing what I had already learned in my life about sales, marketing, and leveraging data. Now that StylemixThemes is a much larger endeavour, I of course have to delegate important tasks so that I can oversee our entire business. For this reason, I have hired an analytics manager. What&rsquo;s great about the progression from performing analysis myself to hiring a bonafide expert in this field, is that I learned more than enough about analysis to be able to engage with my analytics manager effectively. This has meant that I can communicate my ideas better and fully comprehend what my analyst is doing - the journey proved fruitful! So, do not feel bad if you cannot hire an analyst yet, take the opportunity to learn the ropes of analytics as I have, and when the time comes and you do hire a freelance or full time analytics manager, you will be ahead of the game already.</p>
<p>Through analysis, at StylemixThemes we now know which colours our customers prefer, which fonts are most popular, and which blocks/sections are most commonly used in our theme demos, as well as gleaning important information about demographics, growth, and referral success.</p>
<h2>Using Analytics For Design Choices </h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve established that using referral statistics and other analytics is a great guide for where you invest your marketing strategies, but what of design choices and updates? Should you alter and adapt your design choices and updates based on you analyses?</p>
<p>For me, you must take a holistic approach to making design and update changes. You must take into consideration all of your data, including:</p>
<p>● Sales</p>
<p>● Growth</p>
<p>● Trending niches</p>
<p>● Popular features</p>
<p>● Reviews</p>
<p>● Feedback</p>
<p>● Team input</p>
<p>When you combine this data, you can brainstorm with your team and select what needs to be given more attention. Remember, this does not just mean adding things, it could also mean taking a feature away if it is poorly implemented or unintuitive. It could also mean altering aspects of a theme to be easier to use and more efficient. Your analytics could also point you in new, sometimes surprising, directions. Perhaps a theme you felt was going to be a winner proves to be underwhelming. Conversely, you could have a theme which you didn&rsquo;t expect to be overly popular skyrocket up the sales rankings. What&rsquo;s important about all of this is that you should use your analytics as a guide to find out <em>why</em> something is working or not working. Do not be so ridgid that you ignore them, but likewise, do not completely give up on running with a hunch occasionally. I find a combination of hard data and moments of inspiration yields the best results.</p>
<h2>What You Learned in Chapter 18: </h2>

<p>1. What are analytics and data mining?</p>
<p>2. How Envato uses analytics.</p>
<p>3. How to use Google Analytics to generate data.</p>
<p>4. How your data should inform design choices.</p>
<p>This final chapter is so important, so please return to it and continue learning about analytics as a theme developer. Think about how far you&rsquo;ve come! You have covered an introduction to analytics and data mining. You have learned that gathering information about your sales is a key component of marketing and even design. You have learned about three main ways to gather data - ThemeForest Analytics, Envato API, and Google Analytics. The resulting data can then be assessed by you or an analytics manager to help you assess where to invest more in referrals, and which themes are most profitable for you.You have also learned that it is important that you offer a disclaimer so that customers know that some of their sales data will be gathered and used by you and/or your company.</p>
<p>There are other ways you can gather analytics, such as social media polls and email surveys, so always be on the lookout for new approaches to data gathering and analytics so that you are as informed as other theme developers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>Now that we have reached the end of our journey, I want to share a few things with you before you rush off to become a successful theme developer on ThemeForest. Remember, this is all a process. You are never the finished article as a theme developer. Markets shift, new technologies develop, and as an individual there are always opportunities through which to learn and grow. It is my hope that this book is a vital step for you on that journey.</p>
<p>When I first started out as a developer on Envato, it took me a long time to cultivate the correct approach and knowledge to be a success there. Now, my company StylemixThemes is going from strength to strength, generating many thousands of dollars each month in profit. It was a difficult task to accomplish this feat, especially considering the level of competition out there, but now more than ever, it is difficult for new theme authors to rise to the top. There are so many developers, and the ones who are established remain the most visible, generating more sales at the expense of newer ThemeForest authors.</p>
<p><em>I wrote this book to help you in this difficult time; so that you don&rsquo;t need to go through all the</em> <em>trials and tribulations I did. I wrote it for you, so that you can quickly find what works and make a</em> <em>success of your developer business: Stand out, reach Envato Market Power Elite Status, create</em> <em>good support procedures, and generate a constant flow of sales. </em></p>
<p>There are plenty of &ldquo;guidebooks&rdquo; in theme design, but as you will have seen, I took a different approach. Most guidebooks are dry and involve giving hints and tips  which you have no way of verifying. In this book, I took the approach to ground my lessons in my direct experience. It&rsquo;s not about what you can learn in the classroom, but rather what you can learn from my experiences of taking a developer business to the top. This book is filled with life lessons which <em>work</em>. From that perspective, I want you to return to it often so that you can fully glean everything you can from it. This way, you can maximize your chances of success.</p>
<h2>A Word of Warning About Disclaimers </h2>
<p>Before I go, I really need to stress the importance of ensuring that any data gathering you do as a developer is carried out ethically. This means, at the very least, including a disclaimer with your themes that information about demo or product use may be gathered, and at best, offer an opt out option. We offer an alert notice during theme installation and demo import so that our users know exactly what type of data we are gathering. It is critical both legally and ethically that your customers are aware that some aspects of their data such as location and other demographics will be gathered. I&rsquo;ve seen talented developers destroyed by not including relevant documentation, so I wanted to remind you of this - keep your customers abridged of how you will handle their data, even if it&rsquo;s just in the fine print. At least it will be there and will protect you from any legal actions.</p>
<h2>Moving Forward </h2>
<p>Just as I hope that you will continue to push forward, myself and StylemixThemes will do the same. I hope that you will come with me on future journeys. The new battlefield for us is to develop new ways of leveraging our free plugins for WordPress, which we are expanding as we speak. At the time of this writing, competition in this field is fierce, but that&rsquo;s just how we like it at StylemixThemes. I encourage you to have the same desire for your upcoming projects. Push forward, learn, push forward again - a continual march to success.

<h2>My Wish For You </h2>
<p>I hope that you adapt my approach. If you truly want to be successful, you have to invest that which is unique about yourself in your work and business plan. My wish for you is that you learn from my experiences, but then inject your own experiences and goals into the mix. Armed with the information I and StylemixThemes have given you, combined with your own unique take on developing themes, I have every confidence that you will truly excel wherever you apply this approach.</p>
<p>Good luck, and see you out there in the forest!</p>
