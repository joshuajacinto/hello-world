I learned how to program my first iPhone app by taking CS 193P at Stanford University for free. You can find a lot of these courses in the iTunes U library. You can find online curriculum at Michigan, Toronto, Princeton, Berkeley and more. Commercial Learning Libraries: I subscribe to Lynda.com and there are myriad others like Treehouse and Codecademy. Lynda.com is great for programming languages, software, and getting creative insight. Twitter: I joined Twitter when I was looking for a new job. I followed thought leaders in my field, especially those focusing on web design, HTML and CSS. You can do the same — find people who are doing work that you already do, or want to do. Read what they publish and you’ll get a good sense of industry trends. You can also share your own material and establish a reputation. Podcasts: There are likely many podcasts in your industry. Like Twitter, these are great for getting information first-hand from industry thought leaders. I used them to get a good sense of where I should focus my professional development efforts. If you have a commute, this is a fantastic way to pass the time. I don’t have a commute, so I listen to podcasts when I go on long weekend runs. Industry Publications: You can still subscribe to a lot of printed material, but online is far easier. Subscribe to the RSS feeds and email lists of your favorite publishers. You’ll never want for something to read! I subscribe to Fast Company’s Design newsletter and Smashing Magazine. Texture offers a paid subscription for current and back editions of many traditional magazines. Check your local library, too. They may offer free digital magazine subscriptions as part of your membership. Conferences and Meetups: Can you attend an industry conference? You may need to travel but it’s worth it to hear directly from speakers and mingle with like-minded guests. If you cannot attend, some conferences post some of their material online. Try a Meetup, too: they’re smaller local gatherings of people focused on a specific topic. They’re also a great way to meet people, build your network, and reinforce your industry knowledge. Independent Projects: Do you want to learn a new language or have an idea for a new website? Build it yourself. My personal projects have not made me wealthy but they’ve all taught me something.
